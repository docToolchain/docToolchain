There is no `exportDrawIo` task because it is not needed.
When you want to use https://draw.io[draw.io] for your diagrams,
use the free offline version and save your diagrams with the `.png` file extension
(or even better `.dio.png` to easily recognize draw.io images).

Draw.io will save the diagram as PNG file with the diagram source as XML in the meta-data of the PNG!

This let's you easily reference the PNG from within your AsciiDoc files and you can still open and edit it!
