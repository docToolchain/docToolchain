This task exports all issues for a given query(s) from Jira as AsciiDoc table or Excel file.

The configuration for this task can be found within `Config.gradle` (`gradle.properties` can be used as a fallback configuration).
Username/Password is deprecated, so you have to use username/API-token instead.
An API-Token can be created through https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens[].
It is encouraged to keep username and API token out of git repository and to pass it as environment variables to the docToolchain.

== Configuration

Jira configuration support list requests to Jira where results of each requests will be saved in a file with specifies filename. Flags
_saveAsciidoc_ & _saveExcel_ allow users to easily configure in which format results should be saved.

IMPORTANT: Old configuration based on *single Jira query is deprecated* (single 'jql' parameter). Support for it will be removed in the near future. Please migrate to the new configuration that allows multiple Jira queries.
