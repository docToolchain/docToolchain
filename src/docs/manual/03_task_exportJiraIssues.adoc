This task exports all issues for a given query from Jira as AsciiDoc table.

The configuration for this task can be found within `Config.gradle` (`gradle.properties` can be used as a fallback configuration).
Username/Password is deprecated, so you have to use username/API-token instead.
An API-Token can be created through https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens[].
It is encouraged to keep username and API token out of git repository and to pass it as environment variables to the docToolchain.
