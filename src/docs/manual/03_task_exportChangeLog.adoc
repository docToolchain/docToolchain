As the name says, this task exports the changelog to be referenced from within your documentation - if needed.

The source is the git changelog for the path `src/docs` - it only contains the commit messages for changes on the documentation.
All changes on the build or other sources from the repository will not show up.

The changelog is written to `build/docs/changelog.adoc` and contains the changes with _date_, _author_ and _commit message_ already formatted as AsciiDoc table content:

----
| 09.04.2017
| Ralf D. Mueller
| fix #24 template updated to V7.0

| 08.04.2017
| Ralf D. Mueller
| fixed typo
----

You simply include it like this:

----
.Changes
[options="header",cols="1,2,6"]
|====
| Date
| Author
| Comment

\include::../../build/docs/changelog.adoc[]

|====
----

By excluding the table definition, you can easily translate the table headings through different text snippets.

NOTE: it might make sense to only include certain commit messages from the change log or exclude others (starting with `#` or `//`?).
But this isn't implemented yet.
