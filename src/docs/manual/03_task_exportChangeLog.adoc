As the name says, this task exports the changelog to be referenced from within your documentation - if needed.
The changelog is written to `build/docs/changelog.adoc`.

This task can be configured to use different source control system or different directory.
To configure the task, copy `template_config/scripts/ChangelogConfig.groovy` to your directory and modify to your needs.
Then give the path to your configuration file to the task using -PchangelogConfigFile=<your config file>.
See the description inside the template for more details.

By default, the source is the Git changelog for the path `src/docs` - it only contains the commit messages for changes on the documentation.
All changes on the build or other sources from the repository will not show up.
By default, the changelog contains the changes with _date_, _author_ and _commit message_ already formatted as AsciiDoc table content:

----
| 09.04.2017
| Ralf D. Mueller
| fix #24 template updated to V7.0

| 08.04.2017
| Ralf D. Mueller
| fixed typo
----

You simply include it like this:

----
.Changes
[options="header",cols="1,2,6"]
|====
| Date
| Author
| Comment

\include::../../build/docs/changelog.adoc[]

|====
----

By excluding the table definition, you can easily translate the table headings through different text snippets.

NOTE: it might make sense to only include certain commit messages from the change log or exclude others (starting with `#` or `//`?).
But this isn't implemented yet.
