== Configuration
By default no special configuration is necessary.
But, to be more specific on the project and its packages to be used for export,
two optional parameter configurations are available.
The parameters can be used independently from each other.
A sample how to edit your projects Config.groovy is given in the 'Config.groovy'
of the docToolchain project itself.

connection::
Set the connection to a certain project or comment it out to use all project files inside the src folder or its child folder.

packageFilter::
Add one or multiple packageGUIDs to be used for export. All packages are analysed, if no packageFilter is set.
