== Configuration
By default no special configuration is necessary.
But, to be more specific on the project and its packages to be used for export,
six optional parameter configurations are available.
The parameters can be used independently from each other.
A sample how to edit your projects Config.groovy is given in the 'Config.groovy'
of the docToolchain project itself.

connection::
Set the connection to a certain project or comment it out to use all project files inside the src folder or its child folder.

packageFilter::
Add one or multiple packageGUIDs to be used for export. All packages are analysed, if no packageFilter is set.

exportPath::
Relative path to base 'docDir' to which the diagrams and notes are to be exported.
Default: "src/docs".
Example: docDir = 'D:\work\mydoc\' ; exportPath = 'src/pdocs' ;
Images will be exported to 'D:\work\mydoc\src\pdocs\images\ea',
Notes  will be exported to 'D:\work\mydoc\src\pdocs\ea',

searchPath::
Relative path to base 'docDir', in which Enterprise Architect project files are searched
Default: "src/docs".
Example: docDir = 'D:\work\mydoc\' ; exportPath = 'src/projects' ;
Lookup for eap and eapx files starts in 'D:\work\mydoc\src\projects' and goes down the folder structure.
*Note*: In case connection is already defined, the searchPath value is ignored.

glossaryAsciiDocFormat::
Depending on this configuration option, the EA project glossary is exported.
If it is not set or an empty string, no glossary is exported.
The glossaryAsciiDocFormat string is used to format each glossary entry in a
certain asciidoc format.
Following placeholder for the format string are defined: ID, TERM, MEANING, TYPE.
One or many of these placeholder can be used by the output format.

Example: A valid output format to include the glossary as a flat list.
The file can be included where needed in the documentation.
....
glossaryAsciiDocFormat = "TERM:: MEANING"
....
Other format strings can be used to include it as a table row.
The glossary is sorted by terms in alphabetical order.

glossaryTypes::
This parameter is used in case a glossaryAsciiDocFormat is defined, otherwise it
is not evaluated. It is used to filter for certain types. If the glossaryTypes
list is empty, all entries will be used.
Example: glossaryTypes = ["Business", "Technical"]

diagramAttributes::
Beside the diagram image, an EA diagram offers several useful attributes which 
could be required in the resulting document. If set, the string is used to create
and store the diagram attributes to be included in the document.
These placeholders are defined and filled with the diagram attributes if used in the 
diagramAttributes string: %DIAGRAM_AUTHOR%, %DIAGRAM_CREATED%, %DIAGRAM_GUID%, %DIAGRAM_MODIFIED%, %DIAGRAM_NAME%.
Example: diagramAttributes = "Last modification: %DIAGRAM_MODIFIED%"
The resulting text is stored beside the diagram image using same path and file named,
but different file extension (.ad). This can included in the document if required.
If diagramAttributes is not set or string is empty, no file is written.


== Glossary export
By setting the glossaryAsciiDocFormat the glossary terms stored in the EA project
is exported into a folder named 'glossary' below the configured exportPath.
In case multiple EA projects were found for export, one glossary per project is
exported. Each named with the projects GUID plus extension '.ad'.
Each single file will be filtered (see glossaryTypes) and sorted in alphabetical order.
In addition, a global glossary is created by using all single glossary files.
This global file is named 'glossary.ad' and is also placed in the glossary folder.
The global glossary is also filtered and sorted.
In case there is one EA project only, the global glossary is written only.
