This tasks crawls through your whole project looking for AsciiDoc files with a certain name pattern.
It then creates an AsciiDoc file which just includes all files found.

When you create modular documentation, most includes are static.
For example, the arc42-template has 12 chapters and a master template in which those 12 chapters are included.

But when you work with dynamic modules like ADRs - Architecture Decision Records, you create those files on the fly.
Maybe not even within your `/src/docs`folder but right beside the code file for which you wrote the ADR.

In order to include these files in your documentation, you now would have to add the file with its whole relativcve path to one of your AsciiDoc files.

This task will handle it for you!

Just stick with your files names to the pattern `^[A-Z]{3,}-.*` (it beginns with three upper case letters and a dash) and this task will collect this file and write it to your build folder. You only have to include this generated file from within your documentation.

Example:

you have a file called

    /src/jave/yourCompany/domain/books/ADR-1-whyWeUseTheAISINInsteadOFISBN.adoc

The task will collect this file and write another file called

    /build/docs/_includes/ADR_includes.adoc

Which will look like this:

    include::../../../src/jave/yourCompany/domain/books/ADR-1-whyWeUseTheAISINInsteadOFISBN.adoc[]

Obviously, you get the most benefit if you not only have one ADR file, but severals ones which get collected. ðŸ˜Ž

You then include these files in your main documentation by using a single include:

    include::{targetDir}/docs/_includes/ADR_includes.adoc[]
