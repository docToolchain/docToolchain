== How to run Tests

=== Prerequisites

- make sure that Git and Graphviz are installed
- make sure that your Gradle setup is able to work with proxies
- use Java 8

=== Prepare the Project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:docToolchain/docToolchain.git
cd docToolchain/
git checkout V1.0.0         # <1>
git submodule update -i
```
<1> the version to test.
Not needed if you work on the HEAD revision on Master

=== Execute Tests

```bash
rm -r build && ./gradlew test --info
```

The `rm` command ensures that you really have a clean test running.
Otherwise you might get false positives because Gradle will skip steps ('Up-to-date') because artifacts of an older test run still exist.
