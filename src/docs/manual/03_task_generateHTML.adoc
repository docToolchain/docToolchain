This is the standard AsciiDoctor generator which is supported out of the box.

The result is written to `build/html5`.
The HTML files need the images folder to be in the same directory to display correctly.

NOTE: If you would like to have a single-file HTML as result, you can configure AsciiDoctor to store the images inline as `data-uri`. +
Just set `:data-uri:` in the config of your AsciiDoc file. +
But be warned - such a file can become very big easily and some browsers might get into trouble rendering them. +

== Text based Diagrams

For docToolchain, it is configured to use the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-diagram/[asciidoctor-diagram] plugin which is used to create PlantUML diagrams.

The plugin also supports a bunch of other text based diagrams, but http://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] is the most used.

To use it, just specify your PlantUML code like this:

....
.example diagram
[plantuml, "{plantUMLDir}demoPlantUML", png] # <1>
----
class BlockProcessor
class DiagramBlock
class DitaaBlock
class PlantUmlBlock

BlockProcessor <|-- DiagramBlock
DiagramBlock <|-- DitaaBlock
DiagramBlock <|-- PlantUmlBlock
----
....

<1> The element of this list specifies the diagram tool `plantuml` to be used. +
The second element is the name of the image to be created and the third specifies the image type.

NOTE: The `\{plantUMLDir}` ensures that PlantUML also works for the <<generatePDF>> task.
Without it, <<generateHTML>> works fine, but the PDF will not contain the generated images.

IMPORTANT: Make sure to specify a unique image name for each diagram, otherwise they will overwrite each other.

The above example renders as

.example diagram
[plantuml, "{plantUMLDir}demoPlantUML", png]
----
!pragma graphviz_dot jdot
class BlockProcessor
class DiagramBlock
class DitaaBlock
class PlantUmlBlock

BlockProcessor <|-- DiagramBlock
DiagramBlock <|-- DitaaBlock
DiagramBlock <|-- PlantUmlBlock
----

If you want to control the size of the generated diagram in the output, you can configure the "width" attribute (in pixels) or "scale" attribute (floating point ratio) passed to https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-diagram/[asciidoctor-diagram].
For example, if you take the example diagram above and change the declaration to one of the below versions

....
[plantuml, target="{plantUMLDir}demoPlantUMLWidth", format=png, width=250]
# rest of the diagram definition

[plantuml, target="{plantUMLDir}demoPlantUMLScale", format=png, scale=0.75]
# rest of the diagram definition
....

it will render like this:

.example diagram (with specified width)
[plantuml, target="{plantUMLDir}demoPlantUMLWidth", format=png, width=250]
----
!pragma graphviz_dot jdot
class BlockProcessor
class DiagramBlock
class DitaaBlock
class PlantUmlBlock

BlockProcessor <|-- DiagramBlock
DiagramBlock <|-- DitaaBlock
DiagramBlock <|-- PlantUmlBlock
----

.example diagram (with specified scale)
[plantuml, target="{plantUMLDir}demoPlantUMLScale", format=png, scale=0.75]
----
!pragma graphviz_dot jdot
class BlockProcessor
class DiagramBlock
class DitaaBlock
class PlantUmlBlock

BlockProcessor <|-- DiagramBlock
DiagramBlock <|-- DitaaBlock
DiagramBlock <|-- PlantUmlBlock
----

NOTE: PlantUML needs Graphviz dot installed to work.
If you can't install it, you can use the Java based version of the dot library.
Just add `!pragma graphviz_dot jdot` as the first line of your diagram definition.
This is still an experimental feature, but already works quite well! +
