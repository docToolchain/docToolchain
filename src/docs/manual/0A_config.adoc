= Configuration

This appendix covers all configuration introduced by docToolchain.
AsciiDoc, AsciiDoctor, Gradle and other tools and libraries used know of more configuration settings and you can read about those in the corresponding documentation.

== `mainConfigFile` and `docDir`

docToolchain should be easy to use.
That's why the goal is to have one config file with all settings for each project.
But first of all, docToolchain has to know where your documentation project is located.

If `docDir` is defined, the default for `mainConfigFile` is `Config.groovy` in the root folder of your `docDir`.

You have several options to specify the location of your documentation project(`docDir`) and the location of your config gile (`mainConfigFile`).

=== build.gradle

If you use docToolchain as Gradle sub-project as described in https://docs-as-co.de/getstarted/tutorial2[our tutorial], you will have some code in your main `build.gradle` which overwrites the location of the config file:

[source, groovy]
----
//configure docToolchain to use the main project's config
project('docToolchain') {
    if (project.hasProperty('docDir')) {
        docDir = '../.'
        mainConfigFile = 'Config.groovy'
    } else {
        println "="*80
        println "  please initialize the docToolchain submodule"
        println "  by executing git submodule update -i"
        println "="*80
    }
}
----

This way, you can place the config file wherever you like in your project.

Since the `mainConfigFile` is a standard Gradle-Property, you can also overwrite it through a command line option.

NOTE: it is not possible to overwrite properties of a sub project throught the `gradle.properties` of the main project.


=== Commandline
Specify the property on the commandline

    ./gradlew generateHTML -PmainConfigFile=Config.groovy

and if you use the doctoolchain script

    doctoolchain <docDir> generateHTML -PmainConfigFile=Config.groovy

TIP: you can verify the location of your `Config.groovy` by executing docToolchain with the `--info` parameter which sets the loglevel to `info`. It will print the location on the command line (among other settings)

=== Content of the `mainConfigFile`
