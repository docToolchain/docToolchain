Sometimes you have tabular data to be included in your documentation.
Then it is likely that the data is available as Excel sheet or you would like to use MS Excel to create and edit it.

Either way, this task lets you export your Excel sheet and include it directly in your docs.

The task searches for `.xlsx` files and exports each contained worksheet as `.csv` and as `.adoc`.

NOTE: Formulas contained in your worksheet are evaluated and exported statically.

The generated files are written to `src/excel/[filename]/[worksheet].(adoc|cvs)` .
The `src` folder is chosen over the `build` folder to get a better history for all changes on the worksheets.

The files can be included either as AsciiDoc

----
\include::excel/Sample.xlsx/Numerisch.adoc[]
----

or as a CSV file

----
[options="header",format="csv"]
|===
\include::excel/Sample.xlsx/Numerisch.csv[]
|===
----

The AsciiDoc version gives you a bit more control:

- horizontal and vertical alignment is preserved
- col- and row-spans are preserved
- line breaks are preserved
- column width relative to other columns is preserved
- background colors are preserved.

NOTE: see https://github.com/uniqueck/asciidoctorj-office-extension[asciidoctorj-office-extension] for another way how you can use Excel sheets in your docs.
