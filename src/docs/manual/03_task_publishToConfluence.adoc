This target takes the generated HTML file, splits it by headline and pushes it to Confluence.
This enables you to use the docs-as-code approach while getting feedback from non-techies through Confluence comments.
And it fulfills the "requirement" of "... but all documentation is in Confluence".

Special features:

* `[source]`-blocks are converted to code-macro blocks in confluence.
* only pages and images which have changed between task runs are really published and hence only for those changes notifications are sent to watchers. This is quite important - otherwise watchers are easily annoyed by too many notifications.
* `:keywords:` Keywords are attached as labels to every generated Confluence page. The rules for page labels should be kept in mind. See https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/add-remove-and-search-for-labels-136419.html. Several keywords are allowed. They must be separated by comma, e.g. `:keywords: label_1, label-2, label3, ...`. Labels (keywords) must not contain a space character! Use '_' or '-'.

NOTE: code-macro-blocks in confluence render an error if the language attribute contains an unknown language.
See https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/code-block-macro-139390.html for a list of valid language and how to add further languages.

== Configuration

We tried to make the configuration self-explaining, but there are always some note to add.

ancestorId::
this is the page ID of the parent page to which you want your docs to be published.
Go to this page, click on edit and the needed ID will show up in the URL.
Specify the ID as string within the config file.

api::
for cloud instances, `[context]` is `wiki`

preambleTitle::
the title of the page containing the preamble (everything the first second level heading). Default is 'arc42'

disableToC::
This boolean configuration define if the Table of Content (ToC) is disabled from the page once uploaded in confluence. (it is false by default, so the ToC is active)

pagePrefix/pageSuffix::
Confluence can't handle two pages with the same name.
Moreover, the script matches pages regardless of the case. It will thus refuse to replace a page whose title only differs in case with an existing page.
So you should create a new confluence space for each piece of larger documentation.
If you are restricted and can't create new spaces, you can use this `pagePrefix`/`pageSuffix` to define a prefix/suffix for this doc so that it doesn't conflict with other page names.

credentials::
Use username and password or even better username and api-token.
You can create new API-tokens in https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html[your profile].
To avoid having your password or api-token versioned through git, you can store it outside of this configuration as environment variable or in another file - the key here is that the config file is a groovy script.
e.g. you can do things like `credentials = "user:${new File("/home/me/apitoken").text}".bytes.encodeBase64().toString()`

To simplify the injection of credentials from external sources there is a fallback. Should you leave the credentials field empty,
the variables `confluenceUser` and `confluencePassword` from the build environment will be used for authentication. You can set these through any means
allowed by gradle like the `gradle.properties` file in the project or your home directory, environment variables or command-line flags.
For all ways to set these variables, have a look at the https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html[gradle manual].

apikey::
In cases where you have to use full user authorization because of internal confluence permission handling, you need to add the API-token in addition to the credentials.
The API-token cannot be added to the credentials as it is used for user and password exchange.
Therefore the API-token can be added as parameter apikey, which makes the addition of the token as a separate header field with key: `keyId` and value of `apikey`.
Example including storing of the real value outside this configuration: `apikey = "${new File("/home/me/apitoken").text}"`. 

extraPageContent::
If you need to prefix your pages with a warning that this is generated content - this is the right place.

enableAttachments::

If value is set to *true*, your links to local file references will be uploaded as attachments. The current implementation only supports a single folder. This foldername will be used as a prefix to validate if your file should be uploaded or not.
In case you enable this feature, and use a folder which starts with "attachment*", an adaption of this prefix is required.

jiraServerId::
the jira server id your confluence instance is connected to. If value is set, all anchors pointing to a jira ticket will be replaced by the confluence jira macro. 
To function properly jiraRoot has to be configured (see <<exportJiraIssues>>).

Example:

All files to attach will require to be linked inside the document.

``link:attachement/myfolder/myfile.json[My API definition]``

attachmentPrefix::

The expected foldername of your output dir. *Default*: `attachment`

proxy::
If you need to provide a proxy to access Confluence, you may set a map with keys `host` (e.g. `'my.proxy.com'`), `port` (e.g. `'1234'`) and `schema` (e.g. `'http'`) of your proxy.

useOpenapiMacro::
If this option is present and equal to `true`, then any source block marked with class openapi will be wrapped in a swagger-editor macro.
(see https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1218914/open-api-swagger-editor-for-confluence[Elitesoft Swagger Editor], based on swagger-ui) +
This is how you'd include your openapi YAML file: +

== CSS Styling

Some AsciiDoctor features depend on particular CSS style definitions.
Unless these styles are defined, some formatting that is present in the HTML version will not be represented when published to Confluence.

.To configure Confluence to include additional style definitions:
. Log in to Confluence as a space admin
. Go to the desired space
. Select "Space tools", "Look and Feel", "Stylesheet"
. Click "Edit", enter the desired style definitions, and click "Save"

The default style definitions can be found in the AsciiDoc project as https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/master/data/stylesheets/asciidoctor-default.css[asciidoctor-default.css].
Note that you likely do *NOT* want to include the whole thing, as some of the definitions are likely to disrupt Confluence's layout.

The following style definitions are believed to be Confluence-compatible, and enable use of the built-in roles (`big`/`small`, `underline`/`overline`/`line-through`, `_COLOR_`/`_COLOR_-background` for the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#HTML_color_names[sixteen HTML color names]):
