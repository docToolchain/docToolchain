This target takes the generated HTML file, splits t by headline and pushes it to Confluence.
This enables you to use the docs-as-code approach while getting feedback fron non-techies through Confluence comments.
And it fulfills the "requirement" of "... but all documentation is in Confluence" 🤣.

Special feature: only pages and images which have changed between task runs are really published and hence only for those changes notifications are sent to watches.
This is quite important - otherwise watches are easily annoyed by too many notifications.

== Configuration

We tried to make the configuration self-explaning, but theree are always some note to add.

ancestorId::
    this is the page ID of the parant page to which you want your docs to be published.
    Got to this page, click on edit and the needed ID will show up in the URL

api::
for could instances, `[context]` is `wiki`

pagePrefix::
Confluence can't handle two pages with the same name.
So you should create a new confluence space for each piece of larger documentation.
If you are restricted and can't create new spaces, you can use this `pagePrefix` to define a prefix for this doc so that it doesn't conflict with other page names.

credentials::
Use username and password or even better username and api-token.
You can create new API-tokens in https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html[your profile].
To avoid having your password or api-token versioned thorugh git, you can store it outside of this configuration as environment variable or in another file - the key here is that the config file is a groovy script.
e.g. you can do things like `credentilas = "user:${new File("/home/me/apitoken").text}".bytes.encodeBase64().toString()`

extraPageContent::
If you need to prefix you pages with a warning that this is generated content - this is the right place.

== CSS Styling
Some AsciiDoctor features depend on particular CSS style definitions.
Unless these styles are defined, some formatting that is present in the HTML version will not be represented when published to Confluence.

.To configure Confluence to include additional style definitions:
. Log in to Confluence as a space admin
. Go to the desired space
. Select "Space tools", "Look and Feel", "Stylesheet"
. Click "Edit", enter the desired style definitions, and click "Save"

The default style definitions can be found in the AsciiDoc project as https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/master/data/stylesheets/asciidoctor-default.css[asciidoctor-default.css].
Note that you likely do *NOT* want to include the whole thing, as some of the definitions are likely to disrupt Confluence's layout.

The following style definitions are believed to be Confluence-compatible, and enable use of the built-in roles (`big`/`small`, `underline`/`overline`/`line-through`, `_COLOR_`/`_COLOR_-background` for the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#HTML_color_names[sixteen HTML color names]):
