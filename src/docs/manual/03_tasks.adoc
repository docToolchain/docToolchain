= Overview of available Tasks

This chapter explains all docToolchain specific tasks.

The following picture gives an overview of the whole build system:

== Conventions

There are some simple naming conventions of the tasks.
They might be confusing first and that's why they are explained here.

=== generateX

_render_ would have been another good prefix, since these tasks use the plain asciidoctor functionality to render the source to a given format.

=== exportX

These tasks export images and AsciiDoc snippets from other systems or file formats.
The resulting artefacts can then be included from your main sources.

What's different to the _generateX_ tasks is that you don't need to export with each build.

It is also likely that you have to put the resulting artefacts under version control because the tools needed for the export (like Sparx Enterprise Architect or MS PowerPoint) are likely to be not available on a build server or on another contributors machine.

=== convertToX

These tasks take the output from asciidoctor and convert it (through other tools) to the target format.
This results in a dependency on a _generateX_ task and another external tool (currently http://pandoc.org[pandoc]).

=== publishToX

These tasks not only convert your documents but also deploy/publish/move them to a remote system -- currently confluence.
This means that the result is likely to be visible immediately to others.
