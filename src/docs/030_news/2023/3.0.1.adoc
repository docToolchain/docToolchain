We just turned the release-candidate into release v3.0.1

=== About This Release

Wow! The docToolchain community managed to prepare the biggest release in the history of docToolchain! :-)

This release was made possible through the hard work of the following wonderful contributors (in no special order):

@camminati @RoettingerJ @PacoVK @bit-jkraushaar @Frank-dev20 @windows97 @mh182 @rdmueller @dependabot @sparsick @johthor @srotman @PeterStange @klatka

(list was automatically generated by github)

* 14 Contributors
* 23+ fixes
* several additions
* lots of dependency updates

== Notes

* to use the new wrapper, you currently have to fetch it from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/ng/dtcw` or `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/ng/dtcw.ps1` instead of the location mentioned in the tutorial
* `./dtcw local install doctoolchain` and `./dtcw local install java` are now the commands to do an initial local setup 
* generatePDF now needs additional styles, details will follow
* to test the Antora template
** install antora: https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/install/install-antora/
** download the arc42 template as antora style `./dtcw downloadTemplate`
** create a `playbook.yaml` within the root of your project
** make sure that your project is a valid git repository and contains at least one commit
** execute `antora playbook.yml`

[TIP]
====
You like docToolchain? +
What about helping to make it even better? + 
docToolchain is a community project, so be part of the community which drives the project. +
You don't have to code for doing so. +
It would even help to brush up the docs, write tutorials or groom the backlog +
(I guess many of the open issues are already fixed).
