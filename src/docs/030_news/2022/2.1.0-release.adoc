== docToolchain v2.1.0 has Been Released!

=== About This Release

This is the long due announcement of the 2.1.0 release. It has been already released 2022-08-15, but it took me (Ralf) until now (2023-02-15) to create this new post.

You like docToolchain? 
What about helping to make it even better? 
docToolchain is a community project, so be part of the community which drives the project. 
You don't have to code for doing so. 
It would even help to brush up the docs, write tutorials or groom the backlog 
(I guess many of the open issues are already fixed).

IMPORTANT: the docker image has been moved to **doctoolchain**/doctoolchain:v2.1.0
