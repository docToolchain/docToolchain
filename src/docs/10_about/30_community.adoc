=== Why Contributions Matter
Without our amazing community of contributors, the docToolchain project wouldn’t exist in its current form. As an open source project, we depend on the skills and expertise of many to deliver a quality outcome. From developers to technical writers, many people have made valuable contributions to the code and the docs. We’re so grateful to them. We are also thankful for those in our community who take the time to give feedback, create issues, answer questions and send pull requests.

=== Get Involved!
There are so many technologies that support docToolchain, including AsciiDoc, AsciiDoctor, Gradle and arc42. We need all the help we can get to make improvements and keep our project humming. Simply create an issue and send a pull request.
