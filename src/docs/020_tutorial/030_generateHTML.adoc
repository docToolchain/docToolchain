xref:../015_tasks/03_task_generateHTML.adoc[`generateHTML`] and xref:../015_tasks/03_task_generatePDF.adoc[`generatePDF`] are basic tasks which invoke Asciidoctor to generate the output you want.

The output is written to `build/html5/arc42/arc42.html` and `build/pdf/arc42/Arc42.pdf`.

[[html_out]]
.generated output of generateHTML task
image::generateHTML.dio.png[]

As you can see in <<html_out>>, HTML output is rendered as a single page with a table of contents (TOC) on the left.
If using the `withhelp` version, help appears behind question mark icons on the right side of the page.
When readers hold their mouse over each icon, help appears.

[[pdf_out]]
.generated output of generatePDF task
image::generatePDF.png[]

<<pdf_out>> shows you the PDF output.
There is a TOC available on the first pages, and a TOC also appears on the left, helping readers navigate the document.

Both HTML and PDF outputs can be styled to suit your needs.

=== Configuration

==== Files to convert

For both tasks, the most important configuration is `inputFiles`-list at the start of your `docToolchainConfig.groovy`

[source, groovy]
----
inputFiles = [
        //[file: 'doctoolchain_demo.adoc',       formats: ['html','pdf']],
        //[file: 'arc42-template.adoc',    formats: ['html','pdf']],
        /** inputFiles **/
]
----

Normally, Asciidoctor converts all files it can find.
For documents structured using includes, to create a full document (and avoid each chapter being converted to an individual PDF) you'll need a main AsciiDoc file that includes all chapters.

The `inputFiles`-map lists all of the main files as well as a list of formats applicable to each.
For example, this lets you specify which files should be converted to HTML but not to PDF.
You will need to configure this list manually.

If docToolchain converts an unexpected list of files, this is the first place to look when troubleshooting problems.

==== Working with the PDF style

First, execute `./dtcw copyTheme` to copy a simple `pdfTheme` to your own project.
Find it in `/src/docs/pdfTheme`.

Currently, docToolchain uses the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-pdf/[asciidoctor-pdf] library.
The documentation contains a good https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/blob/v1.6.0/docs/theming-guide.adoc[theming guide].

To activate the new style, you have to tell Asciidoctor where to find it.
For maximum flexibility, specify the location and other PDF-related attributes in the file that you want to convert.
The most important ones are:

[source, asciidoc]
----
:pdf-stylesdir: ../pdfTheme
:pdf-style: custom
// only needed when you specify your own fonts
:pdf-fontsdir: ../pdfTheme/fonts
----

For this tutorial, navigate to `src/docs/arc42/arc42.adoc` then add the following to the top of the document:

[source, asciidoc]
----
:pdf-stylesdir: ../pdfTheme
:pdf-style: custom
----

This will specify that AsciiDoc will find the `pdfTheme` relative to the document location in `../pdfTheme` which will result in `src/docs/arc42/../pdfTheme` which is equal to `src/docs/pdfTheme`.

You can also make use of the attribute `\{projectRootDir}` which will contain the absolute path to your project directory.
For example `:pdf-stylesdir: \{projectRootDir}/src/docs/pdfTheme` will search in `**/home/myname/projects/demo**/src/docs/pdfTheme` for the theme.

NOTE: If you want to use the `\{projectRootDir}` in your editor preview, you must define it as a relative path:

[source, asciidoc]
----
ifndef:projectRootDir[:projectRootDir: ../../..]
----

When added to the top of your `arc42.adoc` tutorial file, this will set the `projectRootDir` to the correct folder.

==== Working with the HTML style

The easiest way to modify the HTML style is to add a https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/pass/pass-block/[pass-through block] with the required CSS styles.

[source, asciidoctor]
----
++++
<style>
  h2 {
    color: green;
  }
</style>
++++
----

NOTE: For the `generate**Site**` task, there is a different mechanism to change the styles if the generated microsite.
