== generateSite

The xref:../015_tasks/03_task_generateSite.adoc[`generateSite`] task is more advanced.
In many cases, your goal will not be to create a single HTML document but a whole documentation website.
This is where `generateSite` shines.
It uses a static site generator to turn your document into a nice looking microsite with landing-page, local search and edit links.

The output is written to `build/microsite/output/index.html`.
You can open this file in your browser and view the results.
But you will notice that some features which rely on javascript will be broken.
To avoid this, use the task xref:../015_tasks/03_task_previewSite.adoc[`previewSite`] to start a little webserver which presents you the site without flaws.
