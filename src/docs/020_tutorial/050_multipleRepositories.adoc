== How to generate docs from multiple repositories

Some static site generators sell multi-repository functionality as a feature.
This feature is mainly achieved through a build in git client.

Since we almost always work on systems which already have git installed, docToolchain does not come with its own git client.

The solution we propose instead is just a simple bash script which does the magic for you.
Here is how.

Imagine you have a documentation repository set up with the docToolchain wrapper `dtcw` and some code documents.
Now you would like to include the documents from another repository.

=== git clone solution

To get the contents of the other repository, one way is to do a `git clone` of it right to the `build` folder of your own repository.
Let's call the script in which we store this command `clonerefs.sh`, because we clone a reference to the remote documentation.

.clonerefs.sh
[source, bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash
git clone git@github.com:docToolchain/docToolchain.git build/refs/docToolchain
----

this works fine if you execute it once, but the second time it will complain that the folder `build/refs/docToolchain` is not empty.
So let's create a `cloneOrPull` function which tries first to clone the repo and pulls an update if the clone fails.


.clonerefs.sh
[source, bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash
function cloneOrPull {
  echo ""
  echo $1
  (git clone "$1" "$2" 2> /dev/null && echo "cloned repo" )|| git -C "$2" pull
}

cloneOrPull git@github.com:docToolchain/docToolchain.git build/refs/docToolchain
----

That's better.
We can now include the docs from our main docs.

Do do so, we still need a little Trick. 
We need to reference the docs in the build folder.

We could do something like `include::../../../build/refs/docToolchain/somefile.adoc[]` but this will break.
For this, docToolchain sets the attribute `projectRootDir`. 
With this, we can write the include as `include::{projectRootDir}/build/refs/docToolchain/somefile.adoc[]`.

In order to get `projectRootDir` also in your local preview, create a file called https://intellij-asciidoc-plugin.ahus1.de/docs/users-guide/features/advanced/asciidoctorconfig-file.html[`.asciidoctorconfig`] in the root folder of your project and add

```
:projectRootDir: {asciidoctorconfigdir}
```

as content.

But what if we don't want to include them but just let them render?
We could clone the repository directly to our `src/docs` folder.
But that would require that it only contains docs and no `src/docs` folder itself.
So we have to copy it over to our `src/docs` folder.

.clonerefs.sh
[source, bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash
function cloneOrPull {
  echo ""
  echo $1
  (git clone "$1" "$2" 2> /dev/null && echo "cloned repo" )|| git -C "$2" pull
}

cloneOrPull git@github.com:docToolchain/docToolchain.git build/refs/docToolchain
cp build/refs/docToolchain/src/docs/manual src/docs/.
----

But we don't want to add these folders to our main repository, so let's add it to the `.gitignore` file.

..gitignore
[source, gitignore]
----
[...]
src/docs/manual
[...]
----

There is one more thing we can optimize.
Currently, the script clones the repository with the full history.
This is far to much traffic if you only want to use the latest version of your docs.
Let's add `--depth 1` to the `git clone`command to only fetch the latest version.

.clonerefs.sh
[source, bash]
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash
function cloneOrPull {
  echo ""
  echo $1
  (git clone --depth 1 "$1" "$2" 2> /dev/null && echo "cloned repo" )|| git -C "$2" pull
}

cloneOrPull git@github.com:docToolchain/docToolchain.git build/refs/docToolchain
cp build/refs/docToolchain/src/docs/manual src/docs/.
----

This script will now let you clone remote repositories and merge them with your main documentation before building.

=== git submodule solution

Another solution is to refrence your sub-repositories as https://git-scm.com/book/de/v2/Git-Tools-Submodule[git submodules].
Git submodules are pointers in your main repository to a certain version of another repository.
Most CI/CD systems clone your repository together will als configured submodules.
This makes this approach quite convenient.

A draw back is that submodules are not often used and thus developers are not used to them.

=== artifact solution

A third solution could be that sub-repositories publish their docs as zip file somewhere.
Maybe to an artifactory instance.
Your main repository could fetch the published artifacts and use them in the build process.
That would be exactly what you do with code.
