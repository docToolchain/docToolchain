To work with docToolchain, you first need some documents.
So let's fetch the https://arc42.org[arc42 template] for software architecture documentation.

docToolchain comes with a task called xref:../015_tasks/03_task_downloadTemplate.adoc[`downloadTemplate`].
Let's invoke it and see what happens.

.Linux / WSL2 with bash
[role='primary']

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw downloadTemplate

.Windows with Powershell
[role='secondary']

[source, powershell]
----
./dtcw.ps1 downloadTemplate
----

NOTE: There is an interesting bug with the german version of the arc42 template in conjunction with running docToolchain in powershell: +
The encoding of the files will be wrong.
To fix that, just run `./dtcw.ps1 fixEncoding`.

this might cause problems with plantUML

Out of the box, docToolchain only knows the open source arc42 template for software architecture.
That's why it doesn't ask which template to install.
Since the template exists in four different languages and with or without help on how to use it, docToolchain asks you for these two parameters.
It then downloads the template right from the source, unzips it and reformats it a little bit to fit the needs of docToolchain.
It also adds the template to your configuration file.

That's it.
You have now docToolchain with the arc42 template installed.
Let's render is as HTML, PDF or Microsite in the next steps.
