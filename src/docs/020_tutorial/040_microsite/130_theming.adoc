== How to change the default theme for `generateSite`

The goal of docToolchain is to provide an environment where you can focus on documentation, and not worry about theming.
That's why both the jBake templates and CSS are hidden.

Let's learn how theming works under the hood.
docToolchain builds the result theme from three locations:

. It copies its internal theme into the output path of the site (defaults to `build/microsite/temp/src/site`).
. It looks after the system environment variable `DTC_SITETHEME`. If this variable is set, it takes precedence over the default theme (technically,it is an override at the file level).
. It looks after the theme in your current repository (defaults to `src/site`).

If you want to create a new theme, call the docToolchain task `copyTheme`.
This task copies the theme to the `src/site` location.
After that, you can modify it as you like and create a new zip file with the result.

For more information about what the theme structure looks like, head over to the https://jbake.org/docs/2.6.7/#project_structure[jBake documentation].

The basic template uses Twitter Bootstrap 5 as its CSS framework. Use the `copyThemes` task to copy all hidden jBake resources to your project. You can then remove the resources you don’t need, and change those you want to change.

NOTE: `copyThemes` overwrites existing files, but because your code is safely managed using version control, this shouldn’t be a problem.
