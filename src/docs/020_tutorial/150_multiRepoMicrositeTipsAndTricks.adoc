:jbake-title: Building a microsite from multiple repositories
include::_config.adoc[]

== Multiple Repositories

Modern software development teams maintain several git repositories.
If they commit to having documentation close to the code, they will inevitably have documentation spread over several repositories.
DocToolchain supports building documentation such as a microsite from several repositories precisely by not supporting it in any particular way.
You can just checkout all repositories you need, and extract and arrange the content of their `docs` folders as you need _before_ you build the documentation.

== Backlinks to the repositories

DocToolchain offers two helpful links in the top right corner of every page:

Improve this doc::: Opens a new tab to directly edit the respective page on e.g. GitHub

Create an issue::: Lets you create a new issue in a defined git repository.

The URLs for both activities can be specified in `docToolchainConfig.groovy`, in the fields `issueUrl` and `gitRepoUrl`.
However, if you build your documentation from several repos, you'll want to link to _different_ repos.

A simple fix is to do a postprocessing step with sed and replace the default URLs with the correct ones.
If your way of arranging the documentation folders from the different repos is simple enough,
you can simply run sed with a different URL on each of the different generated folders.

If your arrangement is more complicated, e.g. because you merge all repos ADRs into one folder, you can do a preprocessing step in advance.

. In each repo, automatically set the `:filename:` tag and prefix the value with a unique identifier for the repository.
. Move your adoc files to the desired target folders.
. run `generateSite`
. In the generated HTML files, replace the repository in the backlinks.
By including the prefix in your query, you can make sure to target the correct repository.
