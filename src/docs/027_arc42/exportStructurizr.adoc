[[section-introduction-and-goals]]
== Introduction and Goals

The tool _Structurizr_, created by Simon Brown, bringt the Diagrams-as-Code to the next level.
It reads a textual architecture model and generates diagrams in various formats for all views defined on this model.
In addition, it allows the user to manually layout the generated diagrams.

The goal is to create an integration of the structurizr approach for docToolchain.

== System Scope and Context

=== Business Context

There are two different flows for Structurizr

==== Auto-layout Diagrams

* edit `workspace.dsl` file to update model and views
* use structurizr to auto-generate output files (default: plantUML)
* include plantUML files in AsciiDoc documentation
* repeat

==== Manual-layout Diagrams

* edit `workspace.dsl` file to update model and views
* use Structurizr lite to manually layout view diagrams
* use Structurizr lite to export view diagrams as `.png` or `.svg` files
* reference view diagrams from AsciiDoc documentation
* repeat

NOTE: Structurizr lite is currently the only tool which supports the manual layout

[[section-solution-strategy]]
== Solution Strategy

Structurizr is written in Java and docToolchain can easily make use of Java.
So, for the auto-layout flow, Structurizr can be referenced as Java-library from within as gradle task.


For the manual-layout flow

== Runtime View

== Deployment View

Structurizr is referenced as Gradle script dependency and fetched through the `downloadDepenencies` task.
