== About This Task

Sometimes you need to include tabular data in your documentation.
Most likely, this data will be stored as a MS Excel spreadsheet, or you may like to use Excel to create and edit it.
Either way, this task lets you export an Excel spreadsheet and include it directly in your docs.
It searches for `.xlsx` files and exports each contained worksheet as `.csv` and as `.adoc`.
Note that formulas contained in your spreadsheet are evaluated and exported statically.

The generated files are written to `src/excel/[filename]/[worksheet].(adoc|cvs)`.
The `src` folder is used instead of the `build` folder because a better history of worksheet changes is captured.

The files can be included either as AsciiDoc:

----
\include::excel/Sample.xlsx/Numerisch.adoc[]
----

...or as a CSV file:

----
[options="header",format="csv"]
|===
\include::excel/Sample.xlsx/Numerisch.csv[]
|===
----

The AsciiDoc version gives you a bit more control because the following are preserved:

- Horizontal and vertical alignment.
- col-span and row-span.
- Line breaks.
- Column width relative to other columns.
- Background colors.
