=== About This Task

This task searches for Visio files in the `/src/docs` folder then exports all diagrams and element notes to `/src/docs/images/visio` and `/src/docs/visio`.

Images are stored as `/images/visio/[filename]-[pagename].png`. Notes are stored as `/visio/[filename]-[pagename].adoc`

You can specify a filename to export notes to by starting any comment with `+++{adoc:[filename].adoc}+++`.
It will then be written to `/visio/[filename].adoc`.

=== Important Information About This Task

* Currently, only Visio files stored directly in `/src/docs` are supported. All others will export to the wrong location.
* Before running this task, close any open Visio instance.
