=== About This Task

Whenever Asciidoctor has to process a file that is not UTF-8 encoded, Ruby tries to read it, then throws an error similar to this one:

    asciidoctor: FAILED: /home/demo/test.adoc: Failed to load AsciiDoc document - invalid byte sequence in UTF-8

Unfortunately, finding the incorrectly encoded file is difficult if a lot of `includes::` are used, and Asciidoctor will only show the name of the main document. This is not Asciidoctor's fault. The fault lies with the Ruby interpreter that sits underneath.

The fixEncoding task crawls through all `+++*.ad+++` and `+++*.adoc+++` files and checks their encoding.
If it comes across a file which is not UTF-8 encoded, it will rewrite it with the UTF-8 encoding.
