### About This Task

The *exportMarkdown* task can be used to include [markdown](https://markdown.de) files into the documentation.
It scans the `/src/docs` directory for markdown (`*.md`) files and converts them into Asciidoc files. The converted files can then be referenced from within the `/build`-folder.
