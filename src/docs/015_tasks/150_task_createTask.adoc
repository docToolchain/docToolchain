=== About This Task

You miss a special task in the above list?
Or maybe you want to change a task to better fit your needs?
Why not create your own project specific task?

Execute `./dtcw createTask` and docToolchain will create and configure a custom gradle task for you in a folder `scripts`.

To get started, take a look at {uri-scripts}[all the other tasks] to see how they solve problems.
Copy and modify the code to your own task and start hacking.
