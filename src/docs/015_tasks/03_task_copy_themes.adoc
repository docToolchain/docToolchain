docToolchain provides you with a default theme which reside within docToolchain.
It is just a simple twitter bootstrap theme and it is likely that you want to use another theme in your project.
In order to give you a good start, you can execute `copyThemes` and copy the pdfTheme or jBakeTheme to your project.
Feel free to remove all files which should remain as the default and change all others.
With the next run of docToolchain, it will lay your theme files over the default theme in order to generate the PDF or site.
