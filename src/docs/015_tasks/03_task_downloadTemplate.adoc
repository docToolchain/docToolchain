=== About This Task

This task is primarily used to bootstrap a new project. You can choose to download an official template like https://github.com/arc42/arc42-template[arc42] or https://github.com/Hruschka/req42-framework[req42] (both available in multiple languages) or you can register and use your own custom template.

=== Setup and Configuration

You can choose to bootstrap your project as an Antora project or as a plain AsciiDoc project. The Antora integration is currently in beta. The Antora integration enables you to register the project seamlessly with an existing Antora playbook.
