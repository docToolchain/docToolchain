=== About This Task

This task uses the https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin[Gradle versions plugin] created by Ben Manes to check for outdated build dependencies.
Use this task to keep all dependencies up to date.

WARNING: If you discover newer version, it doesn't mean that versions and dependencies will play nicely together.
To ensure that everything works, we recommend the versions selected by docToolchain contributors.
