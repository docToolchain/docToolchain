== About This Task

For a long time, docToolchain supports the conversion of AsciiDoc files to confluence spaces.
This task now allows you to convert you confluence spaces back to AsciiDoc.

A confluence space will be converted to a "ready to use" set of AsciiDoc files together with a navigation menu.

NOTE: the results of the conversion are quite good. However, don't expect the two tasks `publishToConfluence` and `exportConfluence` to be able to give you a full round-trip without losing some information about the format of your texts.
As an example, numbered headlines will not be automatically converted between both systems.

The task `exportConfluence` parses the entities.xml file of a confluence-space export and creates a hierarchical html export.
It then uses pandoc to convert the HTML files to AsciiDoc.
Since this conversion isn't perfect and pandoc doesn't even know about confluence macros, the script also does some pre- and post-processing.

=== prerequisites

* docToolchain >= v2.2
* you need to have https://pandoc.com[pandoc] installed.

=== usage

export the confluence space as XML and unzip it in the `sample_data` folder.
Configure the right paths in the link:scripts/confluenceToAsciiDoc.groovy[`confluenceToAsciiDoc`] script.

=== usage

Export the confluence space as XML and unzip it in a distinct `sample_data` folder.

To export the confluence space, navigate to the space and then click

* `Space Settings`
* `Manage Space > Export Space`
* `[x] Export Formats: XLM` => `Next`
* `[x] Full Export` => `Export`

Configure the right paths in your `docToolchainConfig.groovy`.

[source, groovy]
....
    export = [
            srcDir: 'sample_data',
            destDir: 'src/docs'
    ]
....

Then use the following steps to run the script and render the results as a microsite:

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw exportConfluence
./dtcw generateSite
----
