=== About This Task

[WARNING]
====
This task is destructive and can harm your environment
====

This task will wipe all content from your Confluence space, configured in your `docToolchainConfig.groovy`.
It will not delete the space itself. The task makes it easy if you want to start from scratch with your documentation, or if you want to re-import your documentation from scratch after you did refactor your document structure and want to get rid of all the old pages.

=== Usage

[source,bash]
----
./dtcw wipeConfluenceSpace -PconfluenceUser=foo.bar@example.corp -PconfluencePass=<REDACTED>
----

You will be asked to confirm the deletion of all pages in the space. Enter `y` to confirm.

[source,bash]
----
...
To honour the JVM settings for this build a single-use Daemon process will be forked. See https://docs.gradle.org/8.1.1/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon.
Daemon will be stopped at the end of the build
