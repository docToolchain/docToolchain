=== About This Task

This task makes use of the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/convert-asciidoc-to-pdf/[asciidoctor-pdf] plugin to render your documents as pretty PDF files.
Files are written to `build/pdf`.
The PDF is generated directly from your AsciiDoc sources. There is no need for an intermediate format or other tools.
The result looks more like a nicely rendered book than a print-to-PDF HTML page.

For a file to be rendered, it has to be configured in the `doctoolchainConfig.groovy` file.
There you will find a section that looks like this:

[source]
----
inputFiles = [
        [file: 'manual.adoc',       formats: ['html','pdf']],
        /** inputFiles **/
]
----

Add the files that you want to be rendered, along with the desired format.
In this case `pdf`.

====
Why do you need to configure the files to be rendered?

Asciidoctor renders all `.adoc` files by default. It doesn't matter if they are the main documents or chapters you want to include.
Most people only want to convert selected files to PDF, so that's why you need to configure which ones.

=== Creating a Custom PDF Theme

If you want to change colors, fonts or page headers and footers, you can do so by creating a `custom-theme.yml` file.
Copy the file `src/docs/pdfTheme/custom-theme.yml` from docToolchain to your project and reference it from your main `.adoc`file by setting the `:pdf-themesdir:`.
In addition, set the `:pdf-theme:` to the name of your theme. In this case `custom`.
For example, insert the following at the top of your document to reference `custom-theme.yml` from the `/pdfTheme` folder.

    :pdf-themesdir: ../pdfTheme
    :pdf-theme: custom
