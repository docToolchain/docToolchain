== About This Task
This task takes a generated HTML file, splits it by headline, and pushes it to your instance of https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence[Confluence].
This lets you use the https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/[docs-as-code approach] even if your organisation insists on using Confluence as its main document repository.

== Special Features

=== Easy Code Block Conversion

`[source]`-blocks are converted to code-macro blocks in Confluence.

Confluence supports a very limited list of languages supported for code block syntax highlighting.
When specifying an unknown language, it would even display an error.
Therefore, some transformation is applied.

* If no language is given in the source block, it is explicitly set to plain text (because the default would be Java that might not always apply).
* Some known and common AsciiDoc source languages are mapped to Confluence code block languages.

* If the language of the source block is not supported by Confluence, it is set to plain text as fallback to avoid the error.

=== Minimal Impact on Non-Techie Confluence Users

Only pages and images that changed between task runs are published, and only those changes are notified to page watchers, cutting down on 'spam'.

=== Keywords Automatically Attached as Labels

`:keywords:` are attached as labels to every Confluence page generated using the `publishToConfluence` task.
See https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/add-remove-and-search-for-labels-136419.html[Atlassian's own guidelines on labels].
Several keywords are allowed, and they must be separated by commas. For example: `:keywords: label_1, label-2, label3, ...`.
Labels (keywords) must not contain a space character. Use either '_' or '-'.

== Configuration

You configure the publishToConfluence task in the file docToolchainConfig.groovy. It is located in the root of your project folder. We try to make the configuration self-explanatory, but below is some more information about each config option.

include::{projectRootDir}/template_config/Config.groovy[tags=input-config]

*ancestorId*

The page ID of the parent page where you want your docs to be published.
Go to this page, click *Edit* and the required ID will show up in the URL.
Specify the ID as a string within the config file.

*api*

For cloud instances, `[context]` is `wiki`.

*disableToC*

This boolean configuration determines whether or not the table of contents (ToC) is disabled on the page once uploaded to Confluence. `false` by default, so the ToC is active.

*pagePrefix/pageSuffix*

Confluence can't handle two pages with the same name - even with different casing (lowercase, UPPERCASE, a mix).
This script matches pages regardless of case and refuses to replace a page whose name differs from an existing page only by casing.
Ideally, you should create a new Confluence space for each piece of larger documentation.
If you are restricted and can't create new spaces, you can use `pagePrefix`/`pageSuffix` to define a prefix/suffix for the doc so that it doesn't conflict with other page names.

*pageVersionComment*

Set an optional comment for the new page version in Confluence.

*credentials*

For security reasons it is highly recommended to store your credentials in a separate file outside the Git repository, such as in your Home folder.

To authenticate with username and API token, use:
    credentials = "user:${new File("/users/me/apitoken").text}" or 
    credentials = "user:${new File("/users/me/apitoken").text}"`.bytes.encodeBase64().toString()` to ........
You can create an API-token in https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/api-tokens-938839638.html[your profile].
    
To authenticate with username and password, use:
    credentials = ......

You can also set your username, password of apitoken as an environment variable. You then do the following:
1. Open the file that contains the environment variables:
    a. On a Mac, go to your Home folder and open the file .zpfrofile.
2. ....


If you wish to simplify the injection of credentials from external sources, do the following:
1. In docToolchainConfig.groovy, do not enter the credentials. Make sure the credentials are escaped.
2. Create a `gradle.properties` file in the project or home directory. See https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html[the gradle user guide].
3. Open the file, and put the variables in it:
    - confluenceUser=myusername, and on a new line
    - confluencePass=myuserpassword
    

*apikey*

In situations where you have to use full user authorisation because of internal Confluence permission handling, you'll need to add the API-token in addition to the credentials.
The API-token cannot be added to the credentials because it's used for user and password exchange.
Therefore the API-token can be added as parameter `apikey`, which makes the addition of the token a separate header field with key: `keyId` and value of `apikey`.
An example (including storing of the real value outside this configuration) is: `apikey = "${new File("/home/me/apitoken").text}"`.

*bearerToken*

You can pass a https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html[Confluence
Personal Access Token] as the `bearerToken`. It is an alternative to
`credentials`. Do not confuse it with `apiKey`.

*extraPageContent*

If you need to prefix your pages with a warning stating that 'this is generated content', this is where you do it.

*enableAttachments*

If value is set to `true`, any links to local file references will be uploaded as attachments. The current implementation only supports a single folder, the name of which will be used as a prefix to validate whether or not your file should be uploaded.
If you enable this feature, and use a folder which starts with 'attachment', an adaption of this prefix is required.

*pageLimit*

Limits the number of pages retrieved from the server to check if a page with this name already exists.

*jiraServerId*
Stores the Jira server ID that your Confluence instance is connected to. If a value is set, all anchors pointing to a Jira ticket will be replaced by the Confluence Jira macro.
To function properly, `jiraRoot` must be configured (see xref:03_task_exportJiraIssues.adoc[`exportJiraIssues`]). Here's an example:

All files to attach will need to be linked inside the document:
``\link:attachment/myfolder/myfile.json[My API definition]``

*attachmentPrefix*

Stores the expected foldername of your output directory. Default is `attachment`.

*proxy*

If you need to provide proxy to access Confluence, you can set a map with the keys `host` (e.g. `'my.proxy.com'`), `port` (e.g. `'1234'`) and `schema` (e.g. `'http'`) of your proxy.

*useOpenapiMacro*

If this option is present and equal to `confluence-open-api` or `swagger-open-api` then any source block marked with `class openapi` will be wrapped in the Elitesoft Swagger Editor macro (see https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1218914/open-api-swagger-editor-for-confluence[Elitesoft Swagger Editor]). The key depends on the version of the macro.

For backward compatibility, if this option is present and equal to `true`, then again the Elitesoft Swagger Editor macro will be used.

If this option is present and equal to "open-api" then any source block marked with class openapi will be wrapped in Open API Documentation for Confluence macro:  (see https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1215176/open-api-documentation-for-confluence[Open API Documentation for Confluence]). A download source (yaml) button is shown by default. +
Using the plugin can be handled on different ways.

* copy/paste the content of the YAML file to the plugin without linking to the origin source by using the url to the YAML file

[source,asciidoc]
--
    [source.openapi,yaml]
    ----
    \include::https://my-domain.com/path-to-yaml[]
    ----
--
* copy/paste the content of the YAML file to the plugin without linking to the origin source by using a YAML file in your project structure:

[source,asciidoc]
--
    [source.openapi,yaml]
    ----
    \include::my-yaml-file.yaml[]
    ----
--
* create a link between the plugin and the YAML file without copying the content into the plugin. The advantage following this way is that even in case the API specification is changed without re-generating the documentation, the new version of the configuration is used in Confluence.

== CSS Styling

Some AsciiDoctor features depend on specific CSS style definitions.
Unless these styles are defined, some formatting that is present in the HTML version will not be represented when published to Confluence.
To configure Confluence to include additional style definitions:

. Log in to Confluence as a space admin.
. Go to the desired space.
. Select *Space tools > Look and Feel > Stylesheet*.
. Click *Edit* then enter the desired style definitions.
. Click *Save*.

The default style definitions can be found in the AsciiDoc project as https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/master/data/stylesheets/asciidoctor-default.css[asciidoctor-default.css].
You will most likely *NOT* want to include the entire thing, as some of the definitions are likely to disrupt Confluence's layout.

The following style definitions are Confluence-compatible, and will enable the use of the built-in roles (`big`/`small`, `underline`/`overline`/`line-through`, `_COLOR_`/`_COLOR_-background` for the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#HTML_color_names[sixteen HTML color names]):
