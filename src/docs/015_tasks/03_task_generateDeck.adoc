=== About This Task

This task makes use of the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/[asciidoctor-reveal.js] backend to render your documents into an HTML-based presentation.
It creates a PowerPoint presentation, then enriches it by adding reveal.js slide definitions in AsciiDoc to the speaker notes.
For best results, use this task with the xref:03_task_exportPPT.adoc[`exportPPT`] task.

==== Configure RevealJs

docToolchain comes with some opinionated, sane defaults for RevealJs.
You can overwrite any of them and provide further configuration as per https://docs.asciidoctor.org/reveal.js-converter/latest/converter/revealjs-options/[asciidoctor-reveal.js] documentation.
