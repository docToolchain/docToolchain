=== About This Task

This task crawls through your entire project looking for AsciiDoc files with a specific name pattern, then creates a single AsciiDoc file which includes only those files.

When you create modular documentation, most includes are static.
For example, the arc42-template has 12 chapters and a master template that includes those 12 chapters.

Normally when you work with dynamic modules like ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) you create those files on the fly.
Maybe not within your `/src/docs` folder, but alongside the code file for which you wrote the ADR.
In order to include these files in your documentation, you have to add the file with its whole relative path to one of your AsciiDoc files.

This task will handle it for you!

Just stick to this file-naming pattern `^[A-Za-z]{3,}[-\_].\*` (begin with at least three letters and a dash/underscore) and this task will collect the file and write it to your build folder.
You only have to include this generated file from within your documentation.
If you provide templates for the documents, those templates are skipped if the name matches the pattern `^.\*[-\_][tT]emplate
[-\_].*`.

=== The Optional Parameter Configurations

You can configure which files are found by the script be setting the parameters in the Config.groovy file.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectRootDir}/template_config/Config.groovy[tags=collectIncludesConfig]
----

=== Example

You have a file called:

    /src/java/yourCompany/domain/books/ADR-1-whyWeUseTheAISINInsteadOFISBN.adoc

The task will collect this file and write another file called:

    /build/docs/_includes/ADR_includes.adoc

...which will look like this:

    include::../../../src/java/yourCompany/domain/books/ADR-1-whyWeUseTheAISINInsteadOFISBN.adoc[]

Obviously, you'll reap the most benefits if the task has several ADR files to collect.

You can then include these files in your main documentation by using a single include:

    include::{targetDir}/docs/_includes/ADR_includes.adoc[]
