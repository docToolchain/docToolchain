[NOTE]
====
Corona/Covid19 is taking its toll.
Time is short in these times and issues are not worked on.
That is why I (rdmueller) have just introduced `sponsored` issues with higher priority.
The label should help to explain why some issues will be preferred over others.
If you want to sponsor an issue, just use the sponsor link on top of this page.

=== create awesome docs!

_docToolchain_ is an implementation of the http://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/[_docs-as-code_] approach for software architecture.
The basis of docToolchain is the philosophy that software documentation should be treated in the same way as code together with the http://arc42.org[_arc42_] template for software architecture.

=== History of this project

I just found an older https://twitter.com/RalfDMueller/status/668540860649349120[tweet] which reminded me of the roots and beginning of this project.
It all began with two important parts.
A script called asciidoc2confluence and some scripts to export diagrams from enterprise architect.

The first one is linked in the tweet above and the first commit dates back to mid of 2015.
Since then, many contributors have joined!
Thanx for all of your contributions!
