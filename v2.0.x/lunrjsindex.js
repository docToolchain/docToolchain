It will also contain questions relevant to the tools used to build docToolchain, but the main focus is docToolchain itself. If you are stuck, make sure that you also check other sources like Stack Overflow . There is also a great FAQ for all your arc42 questions: https://faq.arc42.org/home/ If you have a question or problem for which you can&#8217;t find a solution, you can for this repo, add your question and create a pull request raise the issue through the GitHub issue tracker ask your question on Stack Overflow discuss the problem on Slack Images Asciidoctor User Manual on images Asciidoctor Quick Reference on images AsciiDoctor Writer Guide on images Q: Why are images not shown in the preview of my editor? A: this is most likely because your editor doesn&#8217;t know where they are stored. If you follow the default settings, you probably store your images in a subfolder images . The build script knows about it, because the attribute imagesdir has been set to ./images , but your editor doesn&#8217;t care about the build script - it only checks the currently opened AsciiDoc file. The solution is to add a line to each file which checks if the imagesdir is set and if not, sets it to a valid value: ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: ../images] Q: Which image format should I use? A: AsciiDoc and AsciiDoctor support several formats like GIF, PNG, JPG and SVG. However, if you want to use most features, some formats are better to use than others: GIF is not supported by the PDF renderer. Use JPG or PNG instead. JPG is great for photos but not for diagrams (you might get compression artifacts). So, if you want to use photos from your flipcharts - JPG might work for you. SVG great for high resolution diagrams, but not good supported by DOCX as output format. OpenOffice Writer might display the image a bit stretched, MS Word didn&#8217;t display it at all in some experiments. PDF output might display a warning that newer SVG versions are not supported (happends especially with diagrams.net images). PNG this is the preferred format for images used with docToolchain. All output formats support it and if diagrams are rendered with a resolution high enough to display all details, it will also be scaled well with all output formats. Q: Why are my images rotated in the output? A: This most likely happens when you&#8217;ve taken photos with a mobile device and include them in you docs. A mobile device does not rotate the image itself, it only stores the orientation of the device in the meta data of the photo. Your operating system will show you the image as expected, but the rendered AsciiDoc will not. This can be „fixed“ with Imagemagick, by using convert -auto-orient or mogrify -auto-orient (thanx to @rotnroll666 for this tip). You can also try to just open the image in your favourite editor and re-save it. exportVisio Q: I get an error message saying that a library is not registered when I try to run the exportVisio -task. Ausnahme beim Festlegen von Visible: Das COM-Objekt des Typs Microsoft.Office.Interop.Visio.ApplicationClass kann nicht in den Schnittstellentyp Microsoft.Office.Interop.Visio.IVApplication umgewandelt werden. Dieser Vorgang konnte nicht durchgeführt werden, da der QueryInterface-Aufruf an die COM-Komponente für die Schnittstelle mit der IID {000D0700-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} aufgrund des folgenden Fehlers nicht durchgeführt werden konnte: Bibliothek nicht registriert.

In ...\scripts\VisioPageToPngConverter.ps1:48 Zeichen:1 + $VisioApp.Visible = $false + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + CategoryInfo : NotSpecified: (:) [], SetValueInvocationException + FullyQualifiedErrorId : ExceptionWhenSetting A: When Visio is installed, it registers itself as a com library. It seems that this registration can break. You can fix this by visiting the windows system settings &#8594; install or uninstall a program, select visio , select change and then repair . Sparx Enterprise Architect Q: Sparx Enterprise Architect is a Windows tool, isn&#8217;t it? Yes, it is, but it is written to support CrossOver in order to run on Linux based systems. Wine, the open source branch of CrossOver, seems to work as well. Take a look at this page to see how to install it on a linux based system: https://www.sparxsystems.com/support/faq/ea_on_linux.html I (Ralf) once gave it a try and even managed to get remote control over EA via VBS and COM up and running (which is the pre-requisite for docToolchain). Known error Messages Q: I get the error saying 'Failed to create MD5 hash for file content'. * What went wrong: Failed to capture snapshot of input files for task ':generateHTML' property 'sourceDir' during up-to-date check. &gt; Failed to create MD5 hash for file content.` There are two known reasons for this error. One of the .adoc files is opened in an editor, so that windows can&#8217;t get the lock for that file. &#8594; Close all .adoc files. You use the Bash script doctoolchain on a windows system. &#8594; Use doctoolchain.bat instead. It works even in a Bash Shell. Q: I get the error saying 'Unsupported major.minor version 52.0' This is a sign that you use an outdated version of Java. Please upgrade to Java 8 at least and 14 max. The docToolchain-wrapper (dtcw) in v2.0 will check the java version for you so that you will not see this error message in the future. Q: I get an error message saying 'Error occurred during initialization of VM' Starting a Gradle Daemon, 1 incompatible Daemon could not be reused, use --status for details FAILURE: Build failed with an exception. * What went wrong: Unable to start the daemon process. … Error occurred during initialization of VM Could not reserve enough space for 2097152KB object heap Somehow docToolchain can&#8217;t allocate the memory which is configured out of the box. Try to free up some memory or comment out the line org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2048m in gradle.properties Q: I get the error saying Could not initialize class java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment$LocaleGE This seems to be a problem with WSL on Windows. Some sources mention to run Java in headless mode, but in this case, it doesn&#8217;t solve the problem. The root cause seems to be plantUML trying to get some font information. Only real solution seems to be to shutdown WSL from a powershell window wiht wsl --shutdown and retry. Warning this will kill all your WSL terminals without warning. Another solution seems to be to install a fresh version of your java runtime (I thought it is immutable, but it really helps). Best Solution is to switch to powershell. Another solution is to avoid PlantUML and generate Diagrams through a kroki.io server. Another variant of this is Can&#8217;t connect to X11 window server using '192.168.189.153:0' as the value of the DISPLAY variable. . In this case, it might help to install an X-Server (x410 for example) and configure the DISPLAY variable correctly. An easy way to test you configuration is to run xeyes in WSL. "

Benefits of the docs-as-code Approach /images Introduction and Goals 5 minutes to read Note Jump directly to the github repository Create awesome docs! docToolchain is an implementation of the docs-as-code approach for software architecture plus some additional automation. The basis of docToolchain is the philosophy that software documentation should be treated in the same way as code together with the arc42 template for software architecture. How it all began&#8230;&#8203; docs-as-code Before this project started, I wasn&#8217;t aware of the term docs-as-code . I just got tired of keeping all my architecture diagrams up to date by copying them from my UML tool over to my word processor. As a lazy developer, I told myself &#8216;there has to be a better way of doing this&#8217;. And I started to automate the diagram export and switched from a full fledged word processor over to a markup renderer. This enabled me to reference the diagrams from within my text and update them just before I render the document. arc42 Since my goal was to document software architectures, I was already using arc42, a template for software architecture documentation. At that time, I used the MS Word template. But what is arc42? Dr. Gernot Starke and Peter Hruschka created this template in a joint effort to create a standard for software architecture documents. They dumped all their experience about software architectures not only into a structure but also explaining texts. These explanations are part of every chapter of the template and give you guidance on how to write each chapter of the document. arc42 is available in many formats like MS Word, textile, and Confluence. All these formats are automatically generated from one golden master formatted in AsciiDoc . docToolchain In order to follow the docs-as-code approach, you need a build script that automates steps like exporting diagrams and rendering the used Markdown ( AsciiDoc in case of docToolchain ) to the target format. Unfortunately, such a build script is not easy to create in the first place (&#8216;how do I create .docx?&#8217;, &#8216;why does lib x not work with lib y?&#8217;) and it is also not too easy to maintain. docToolchain is the result of my journey through the docs-as-code land. The goal is to have an easy to use build script that only has to be configured and not modified and that is maintained by a community as open source software. The technical steps of my journey are written down in my blog: https://rdmueller.github.io . Let&#8217;s start with what you&#8217;ll get when you use docToolchain &#8230;&#8203; Benefits of the docs-as-code Approach You want to write technical docs for your software project. So it is likely you already have the tools and processes to work with source code in place. Why not also use it for your docs? Document Management System By using a version control system like Git , you get a perfect document management system for free. It lets you version your docs, branch them and gives you an audit trail. You are even able to check who wrote which part of the docs. Isn&#8217;t that great? Since your docs are now just plain text, it is also easy to do a diff and see exactly what has changed. And when you store your docs in the same repository as your code, you always have both in sync! Collaboration and Review Process Git as a distributed version control system even enables collaboration on your docs. People can fork the docs and send you pull requests for the changes they made. By reviewing the pull request, you have a perfect review process out of the box - by accepting the pull request, you show that you&#8217;ve reviewed and accepted the changes. Most Git frontends like Bitbucket , GitLab and of course GitHub also allow you to reject pull requests with comments. Image References and Code Snippets Instead of pasting images to a binary document format, you now can reference images. This will ensure that those images are always up to date every time you rebuild your documents. In addition, you can reference code snippets directly from your source code. This way, these snippets are also always up to date! Compound and Stakeholder-Tailored Docs Since you can not only reference images and code snippets but also sub-documents, you can split your docs into several sub-documents and a master, which brings all those docs together. But you are not restricted to one master&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you can create master docs for different stakeholders that only contain the chapters needed for them. Many more Features&#8230;&#8203; If you can dream it, you can script it. Want to include a list of open issues from Jira? ✓ Check. Want to include a changelog from Git? ✓ Check. Want to use inline, text based diagrams? ✓ Check. and many more&#8230;&#8203; "

AsciiDoc, AsciiDoctor, Gradle and other tools and libraries used know of more configuration settings and you can read about those in the corresponding documentation. mainConfigFile and docDir docToolchain should be easy to use. That&#8217;s why the goal is to have one config file with all settings for each project. But first of all, docToolchain has to know where your documentation project is located. If docDir is defined, the default for mainConfigFile is Config.groovy in the root folder of your docDir . You have several options to specify the location of your documentation project ( docDir ) and the location of your config file ( mainConfigFile ). build.gradle If you use docToolchain as Gradle sub-project as described in our tutorial , you will have some code in your main build.gradle which overwrites the location of the config file: //configure docToolchain to use the main project's config project('docToolchain') { if (project.hasProperty('docDir')) { docDir = '../.' mainConfigFile = 'Config.groovy' } else { println =*80 println  please initialize the docToolchain submodule println  by executing git submodule update -i println =*80 } } This way, you can place the config file wherever you like in your project. Since the mainConfigFile is a standard Gradle-Property, you can also overwrite it through a command line option. Note it is not possible to overwrite properties of a sub project throught the gradle.properties of the main project. Commandline Specify the property on the commandline ./gradlew generateHTML -PmainConfigFile=Config.groovy and if you use the doctoolchain script doctoolchain &lt;docDir&gt; generateHTML -PmainConfigFile=Config.groovy Tip you can verify the location of your Config.groovy by executing docToolchain with the --info parameter which sets the loglevel to info . It will print the location on the command line (among other settings) Content of the mainConfigFile Unresolved directive in &lt;stdin&gt; - include::../../../Config.groovy[tags=**] AsciiDoc config Command Line Parameters "

    "text": " Table of Contents How to install docToolchain Get the Wrapper run a first command Existing documents arc42 from scratch Build How to install docToolchain 5 minutes to read Get the Wrapper The basic strategy on how to install docToolchain has changed with V2.x. You now install a small wrapper scripts to your project which does the rest for you: Linux / WSL2 with bash cd &lt;your project&gt; wget doctoolchain.github.io/dtcw chmod +x dtcw if you don&#8217;t have wget installed, you can also use curl : cd &lt;your project&gt; curl -Lo dtcw doctoolchain.github.io/dtcw chmod +x dtcw Windows with Powershell cd &lt;your project&gt; wget doctoolchain.github.io/dtcw.ps1 -Outfile dtcw.ps1 Windows with cmd.exe cd &lt;your project&gt; curl -Lo dtcw.bat doctoolchain.github.io/dtcw.bat Note dtcw.bat wraps the dtcw.ps1 script and executes it in powershell. This might be easier to use if you haven&#8217;t yet configured your powershell as a developer. Note In order to support development for your project on both, Linux and Windows, it makes sense to download all three scripts to your project. Note if you use cmd.exe , please follow the instructions for powershell in the manual. We will not further differentiate between both. The wrapper helps you in several ways: it ensures that everyone who uses your repository, uses the same version of docToolchain it keeps all the technology out of your repository it wraps all your commands and directs them to your local docToolchain installation even more, it checks the way you have docToolchain installed and if it hasn&#8217;t been installed, it will install it for you via direct download or docker run a first command To get started, you can run tasks as a first command: Linux / WSL2 with bash ./dtcw tasks --group=doctoolchain Windows with Powershell ./dtcw.ps1 tasks --group=doctoolchain This command will show you all tasks available through docToolchain, but first it will make sure that docToolchain is installed: it checks for a configuration file and creates a default one if none is available. it prefers a local installation if docker is available and no local installation, it will use docker. The download of the images might take a while when run for the first time if docker is not available, it will download and install docToolchain to your home folder it will then run a gradle build through the gradle wrapper. This will download and isntall gradle when run for the first time. the gradle build will also fetch some dependencies. This will also take some time when run for the first time. As you can see, the installation is an incremental process and will take some time because of additional downloads. After the first few commands, you will have all the needed dependencies installed and things will be faster. Existing documents If you already have some existing documents in AsciiDoc format in your project, you need to tell docToolchain where it can find these documents. To do so, take a look at the created docToolchainConfig.groovy and update it. arc42 from scratch If you don&#8217;t have existing documents yet, or if you need a fresh start, you can get the arc42 template in AsciiDoc format. Run the following command to ask docToolchain to download the template of your choice: Linux ./dtcw downloadTemplate Windows ./dtcw.ps1 downloadTemplate Build By now, docToolchain is installed in some way, the docToolchain wrapper dtcw resides in your project folder and the arc42 template is installed. Now let&#8217;s render it as HTML and PDF. should be installed as command line tool and the path to its bin folder should be on your path. If you now switch to your freshly initialized &lt;newDocDir&gt;, you should be able to execute the following commands: Linux doctoolchain &lt;docDir&gt; generateHTML doctoolchain &lt;docDir&gt; generatePDF Windows doctoolchain.bat &lt;docDir&gt; generateHTML doctoolchain.bat &lt;docDir&gt; generatePDF &lt;docDir&gt; may be relative, e.g. ., or absolute. As a result, you will see the progress of your build together with some warnings which you can just ignore for the moment. The first build generated some files within the &lt;docDir&gt;/build : build |-- html5 | |-- arc42-template.html | `-- images | |-- 05_building_blocks-EN.png | |-- 08-Crosscutting-Concepts-Structure-EN.png | `-- arc42-logo.png `-- pdf |-- arc42-template.pdf `-- images |-- 05_building_blocks-EN.png |-- 08-Crosscutting-Concepts-Structure-EN.png `-- arc42-logo.png Congratulations! If you see the same folder structure, you just managed to render the standard arc42 template as html and pdf!

Müller Anhand eines großen Systems zeigen Gernot und Ralf, wie Sie mit ziemlich wenig Aufwand angemessene und vernünftige Dokumentation für unterschiedliche Stakeholder produzieren – sodass Entwicklungsteams dabei auch noch Spaß haben. Unser Rezept: AsciiDoc mit arc42 mischen, Automatisierung mit Gradle und Maven hinzufügen und mit Diagramm- oder Modellierungstools Ihrer Wahl kombinieren. Schon sind schicke HTML- und reviewfähige PDF-Dokumente fertig. Auf Wunsch gibts DOCX und Confluence als Zugabe. Wir zeigen, wie Sie Doku genau wie Quellcode verwalten können, stakeholderspezifische Dokumente erzeugen und Diagramme automatisiert integrieren können. Einige Teile dieser Doku können Sie sogar automatisiert testen. Zwischendurch bekommen Sie zahlreiche Tipps, wie und wo Sie systematisch den Aufwand für Dokumentation reduzieren können und trotzdem lesbare, verständliche und praxistaugliche Ergebnisse produzieren. Gesunde Dokumentation mit AsciiDoctor Alexander Schwartz Autoren möchten Inhalte effizient dokumentieren und vorhandene Inhalte wiederverwenden. Ein Leser möchte das Dokument in einem ansprechenden Layout präsentiert bekommen. Das textbasierte AsciiDoc-Format bietet für einen Entwickler oder technischen Redakteur alle notwendigen Auszeichungselemente, um auch anspruchsvolle Dokumente zu schreiben. So werden unter anderem Tabellen, Fußnoten und annotierte Quellcodes unterstützt. Gleichzeitig ist es ähnlich leichtgewichtig wie z.B. das Markdown Format. Für die Leser wird HTML, PDF oder EPUB generiert. Da AsciiDoc wie Programmcode eingecheckt wird und Merge-Operationen einfach möglich sind, können Programmcode und Dokumentation zusammen versioniert und auf einem einheitlichen Stand gehalten werden. Der Vortrag gibt eine kurze Einführung in AsciiDoc und die dazugehörigen Werkzeuge. "

To manually build and upload the image, download the repository, switch to branch ng-beta , cd to the alpine folder and execute docker build -t rdmueller/doctoolchain:v2.0.0-rc15 . . Afterwards use docker desktop to push the resulting image to the hub. sdkman A github action has been created to deploy to sdkman: sdkman deploy . set version to the same as for the other relases but without the pre-pended v : X.Y.Z use as download link the link to the docToolchain-dist.zip from the github release (hint: looks like https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/releases/download/v1.3.1/docToolchain-dist.zip ) "

    "text": " Table of Contents Setup Development Environment local install, docker, sdkman Create Gradle independent tasks Create or Change a Theme Setup Development Environment 4 minutes to read Since v2.0, all the code is hidden from curious eyes when you install docToolchain. To access and change the code, you first have to know some details about the inner workings. local install, docker, sdkman Development is based on the local installation of docToolchain. Docker simply contains a local install and sdkman install docToolchain locally, but the location is controller by sdkman and not docToolchain. This is why you need a local installation for development. Docker and sdkman are derived from it. The docToolchain-Wrapper installs docToolchain locally to $HOME/.doctoolchain/docToolchain-$v2.6.5/ . All task invokations through the docToolchain wrapper dtcw are redirected to $HOME/.doctoolchain/docToolchain-$v2.6.5/bin/doctoolchain . This is another shell script which calls the gradle wrapper for most tasks. So create a local install which is connected to your github fork of docToolchain, create a folder called $HOME/.doctoolchain/docToolchain-2.0.0-dev/ and checkout the ng-branch of your fork to this folder. To use this version in your test project, edit the version configured at the start of your dtcw script to 2.0.0-dev . Note you have now the full repository locally cloned. To save memory, only some parts of this repository are zipped for distribution. Check out the prepareDist-Task if you run into problems. Create Gradle independent tasks Currently, all tasks use Gradle to run. To make docToolchain faster, it makes sense to circumvent Gradle for tasks where it doesn&#8217;t add any benefits. To do so, you can use the bin/doctoolchain scripts and create a switch. Create or Change a Theme Not only the docToolchain code but also the themes for the static site generator jBake are hidden. Overwrite Theme for a Project When docToolchain builds the static website, it first copies an internal theme to a temp-folder, then copies an external theme (if defined) over it and as a last step, it copies the project theme over it. This gives you the chance to overwrite some parts of the theme on a per project basis. To make it easier, run the copyThemes task. It will copy the internal and external theme to microsite.siteFolder . You can then check those files (take a look at jbake.org to get a better understanding), modify the ones you wish to change and delete all others. Create a new Theme An external theme is in fact just a zipped copy of the microsite.siteFolder as mentioned in the previous chapter. All themes are once downloaded when referenced from a dtcw configuration and are stored in $HOME/.doctoolchain/themes/[hash of url] . If you want to modify an existing theme, go to its folder and checkout the theme&#8217;s project instead of the downloaded copy. This will give you the connection back to the github repository and you can modify the theme directly in $HOME/.doctoolchain/themes/[hash of url] . If you want to create a new theme from scratch, the hash is a simple md5 hash. So, for example, if you configure your new theme as myTheme , then myTheme.md5() will be the hash. Special functionality for Themes Config Fragments It is quite likely that you need a new config item for your self generated theme. And wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if the user would be asked to set a value for this new config item when she installs the theme for the first time? Create a file configFragment.groovy in the site folder of your theme. Here is an example for what to put in this file: // the title of the microsite, displayed in the upper left corner // Example: my new site title = '##site-title##' The first line is some explanation displayed to the user. You can have several lines of explanations. The second line, starting with Example: is used as default value for the prompt. The third line is the config item itself. If the value is surrounded by ## , the user will be prompted for this value and it will be replaced with the user&#8217;s input. Otherwise, the config item will be added without a prompt to the users current docToochainConfig.groovy . "

Here are some tips that might help you. General Advice To dig deeper into the workings of docToolchain, it makes sense that you setup yourself a development environment. This gives you the chance to add extra debug output to the tasks which you want to inspect. Gradle You get most hints on what is going on in regards to gradle when you add the --info flag to your command. ./dtcw generateSite --info This will output all configuration settings as seen by docToolchain and many more internal bits. jBake Templates If something goes wrong within a template, you often get not much information. Take a look at menu.gsp to see how you can use try/catch blocks to get an error message. But to find out where the problem occurs, you need to use poor mans debugger and add some System.out.println statements. Make sure that you use the full System.out.println statement and not only println . Otherwise, you will see no output. Theming / Menu / Images It might seem a bit like magic how the system creates the menu entries. Sometimes you don&#8217;t find the reason why an image is not shown. Remember, that you can check out the generated files. Check the build/microsite/tmp folder to see the folder which is fed into jBake. In this folder, all files will have additional jbake attributes which are used to build the menu. They are generated from the original attributes of the file and folder/filename information. Check the build/microsite/output folder to see the generated result. This often helps to check where an image actually is located. "

Otherwise you might get false positives because Gradle will skip steps ('Up-to-date') because artifacts of an older test run still exist. Proxy Setting for Tests The docToolchain test setup is based on the Gradle-Test-Kit and makes use of the Spock test execution framework . The gradle test runner is started in its own test environment and its own JVM instance. As a result the global proxy settings are ignored. As workarund to execute the test with the correct proxy settings it is necessary to copy the proxy setting normally done in the in gradle.properties located in the user directory to the gradle.properties file located in the docToolchain folder itself. Note The files downloaded by the Gradle test Runner are placed in a different folder than the default gradle cache.

See related issue 4 minutes to read Tip Blog-Posts: JIRA to Sparx EA , Did you ever wish you had better Diagrams? Configuration By default no special configuration is necessary. But, to be more specific on the project and its packages to be used for export, six optional parameter configurations are available. The parameters can be used independently from each other. A sample how to edit your projects Config.groovy is given in the 'Config.groovy' of the docToolchain project itself. connection Set the connection to a certain project or comment it out to use all project files inside the src folder or its child folder. packageFilter Add one or multiple packageGUIDs to be used for export. All packages are analysed, if no packageFilter is set. exportPath Relative path to base 'docDir' to which the diagrams and notes are to be exported. Default: src/docs. Example: docDir = 'D:\work\mydoc\' ; exportPath = 'src/pdocs' ; Images will be exported to 'D:\work\mydoc\src\pdocs\images\ea', Notes will be exported to 'D:\work\mydoc\src\pdocs\ea', searchPath Relative path to base 'docDir', in which Enterprise Architect project files are searched Default: src/docs. Example: docDir = 'D:\work\mydoc\' ; exportPath = 'src/projects' ; Lookup for eap and eapx files starts in 'D:\work\mydoc\src\projects' and goes down the folder structure. Note : In case parameter 'connection' is already defined, the searchPath value is used, too. exportEA starts opening the database parameter 'connection' first and looks afterwards for further project files either in the searchPath (if set) or in the docDir folder of the project. glossaryAsciiDocFormat Depending on this configuration option, the EA project glossary is exported. If it is not set or an empty string, no glossary is exported. The glossaryAsciiDocFormat string is used to format each glossary entry in a certain asciidoc format. Following placeholder for the format string are defined: ID, TERM, MEANING, TYPE. One or many of these placeholder can be used by the output format. Example: A valid output format to include the glossary as a flat list. The file can be included where needed in the documentation. glossaryAsciiDocFormat = TERM:: MEANING Other format strings can be used to include it as a table row. The glossary is sorted by terms in alphabetical order. glossaryTypes This parameter is used in case a glossaryAsciiDocFormat is defined, otherwise it is not evaluated. It is used to filter for certain types. If the glossaryTypes list is empty, all entries will be used. Example: glossaryTypes = [Business, Technical] diagramAttributes Beside the diagram image, an EA diagram offers several useful attributes which could be required in the resulting document. If set, the string is used to create and store the diagram attributes to be included in the document. These placeholders are defined and filled with the diagram attributes if used in the diagramAttributes string: %DIAGRAM_AUTHOR%, %DIAGRAM_CREATED%, %DIAGRAM_GUID%, %DIAGRAM_MODIFIED%, %DIAGRAM_NAME%. %DIAGRAM_NOTES%, Example: diagramAttributes = Last modification: %DIAGRAM_MODIFIED% You can add the string %NEWLINE% where a line break shall be added. The resulting text is stored beside the diagram image using same path and file named, but different file extension (.ad). This can included in the document if required. If diagramAttributes is not set or string is empty, no file is written. Glossary export By setting the glossaryAsciiDocFormat the glossary terms stored in the EA project is exported into a folder named 'glossary' below the configured exportPath. In case multiple EA projects were found for export, one glossary per project is exported. Each named with the projects GUID plus extension '.ad'. Each single file will be filtered (see glossaryTypes) and sorted in alphabetical order. In addition, a global glossary is created by using all single glossary files. This global file is named 'glossary.ad' and is also placed in the glossary folder. The global glossary is also filtered and sorted. In case there is one EA project only, the global glossary is written only.

Using this approach allows you to embed your diagrams into AsciiDoc source as you normally do with the image:: macro, with the added advantage of storing the diagram source with the image itself. Note If you are converting a Confluence page with embedded draw.io diagrams to AsciiDoc, you can use this export workflow to continue to enjoy the draw.io editing experience.

Click Export to save the PNG file with the pattern [file].dio.png . Note Specifying .dio (short for  d raw io ) in the name will help you identify PNG files containing embedded XML diagram source. Commit the exported PNG file to source control. You now have a diagram that can be managed in source control, added to your documentation source, and edited using a draw.io Desktop version. Note Draw.io offers free and open source desktop editors for all major operating system platforms. See https://about.draw.io/integrations/ to find a desktop editor application compatible with your operating system. When you use the desktop version, just create your diagram with the .png or even better .dio.png extension and draw.io will always save your diagam as PNG with the source as meta data. NEW! Draw.io is now called diagrams.net and there is a free plugin for VS Code and IntelliJ to edit your diagrams even offline! "

The following picture gives an overview of the whole build system: Figure 1. docToolchain Conventions There are some simple naming conventions for the tasks. They might be confusing at first and that&#8217;s why they are explained here. generateX render would have been another good prefix, since these tasks use the plain AsciiDoctor functionality to render the source to a given format. exportX These tasks export images and AsciiDoc snippets from other systems or file formats. The resulting artifacts can then be included from your main sources. What&#8217;s different from the generateX tasks is that you don&#8217;t need to export with each build. It is also likely that you have to put the resulting artifacts under version control because the tools needed for the export (like Sparx Enterprise Architect or MS PowerPoint) are likely to be not available on a build server or on another contributor&#8217;s machine. convertToX These tasks take the output from AsciiDoctor and convert it (through other tools) to the target format. This results in a dependency on a generateX task and another external tool (currently pandoc ). publishToX These tasks not only convert your documents but also deploy/publish/move them to a remote system&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;currently Confluence. This means that the result is likely to be visible immediately to others. "

The result is written to build/html5 . The HTML files need the images folder to be in the same directory to display correctly. Note If you would like to have a single-file HTML as result, you can configure AsciiDoctor to store the images inline as data-uri . Just set :data-uri: in the config of your AsciiDoc file. But be warned - such a file can become very big easily and some browsers might get into trouble rendering them. https://rdmueller.github.io/single-file-html/ Text based Diagrams For docToolchain, it is configured to use the asciidoctor-diagram plugin which is used to create PlantUML diagrams. The plugin also supports a bunch of other text based diagrams, but PlantUML is the most used. To use it, just specify your PlantUML code like this: .example diagram [plantuml, {plantUMLDir}demoPlantUML, png] # (1) ---- class BlockProcessor class DiagramBlock class DitaaBlock class PlantUmlBlock BlockProcessor &lt;|-- DiagramBlock DiagramBlock &lt;|-- DitaaBlock DiagramBlock &lt;|-- PlantUmlBlock ---- The element of this list specifies the diagram tool plantuml to be used. The second element is the name of the image to be created and the third specifies the image type. Note The {plantUMLDir} ensures that PlantUML also works for the [generatePDF] task. Without it, generateHTML works fine, but the PDF will not contain the generated images. Important Make sure to specify a unique image name for each diagram, otherwise they will overwrite each other. The above example renders as Figure 1. example diagram If you want to control the size of the generated diagram in the output, you can configure the width attribute (in pixels) or scale attribute (floating point ratio) passed to asciidoctor-diagram . For example, if you take the example diagram above and change the declaration to one of the below versions [plantuml, target={plantUMLDir}demoPlantUMLWidth, format=png, width=250] # rest of the diagram definition [plantuml, target={plantUMLDir}demoPlantUMLScale, format=png, scale=0.75] # rest of the diagram definition it will render like this: Figure 2. example diagram (with specified width) Figure 3. example diagram (with specified scale) Note PlantUML needs Graphviz dot installed to work. If you can&#8217;t install it, you can use the Java based version of the dot library. Just add !pragma graphviz_dot smetana as the first line of your diagram definition. This is still an experimental feature, but already works quite well! https://rdmueller.github.io/plantuml-without-graphviz/ Tip Blog-Posts: PlantUML with Gradle , plantUML with Asciidoctor-pdf , plantUML revisited , How to use PlantUML without Graphviz Source AsciiDocBasics.gradle task generateHTML ( type: AsciidoctorTask, group: 'docToolchain', description: 'use html5 as asciidoc backend') { attributes ( 'plantUMLDir' : file(${docDir}/${config.outputPath}/html5).toURI().relativize(new File(${docDir}/${config.outputPath}/html5/plantUML/).toURI()).getPath() ) onlyIf { !sourceFiles.findAll { 'html' in it.formats }.empty } // specify output folder explicitly to avoid cleaning targetDir from other generated content outputDir = file(targetDir + '/html5/') separateOutputDirs(false) sources { sourceFiles.findAll { 'html' in it.formats }.each { include it.file println it.file } } resources { config.imageDirs.each { imageDir -&gt; from(new File(file(srcDir),imageDir)) logger.info ('imageDir: '+imageDir) } into './images' } backends = ['html5'] } "

When your documentation grows, and you have several documents, you need a microsite which bundles all the information. The generateSite task uses jBake to create a static site with a Landingpage, Blog and Search. Pages The microsite is page oriented instead of document oriented. It is likely that you already organized your documents by chapter. Use these chapters as pages to create a great user experience. The arc42-template sources are a good example. In order to include a page in the microsite, add a meta-data header to it. page meta-data :jbake-menu: arc42 :jbake-title: Solution Strategy :jbake-order: 4 :jbake-type: page_toc :jbake-status: published :filename: 015_tasks/03_task_generateSite.adoc :imagesdir: ../../images :toc: [[section-solution-strategy]] === Solution Strategy jbake-menu the top-level menu for this page. Defaults to the top-level folder name of the adoc file within the docDir . jbake-title the title to be displayed in the drop-down top-level menu. Defaults to the first headline of the file. jbake-order give the drop-down entries a sort order. Defaults to a prefixed number of the file like 04 _filename.adoc or to the prefixed number of the second level folder name. jbake-type the page type. This controls which template is used to render the page. You will mostly use page for a full-width page or page_toc for a page with a table of contents (toc) rendered on the left. Defaults to page_toc . jbake-status draft or published . Only published pages will be rendered. Defaults to published for files with a jbake-order and draft for files without order or files prefixed with _ . filename needed for edit and feedback-links (coming soon). Defaults to the filename :-) ifndef this fixes the imagesdir according to the nesting level of your docs folder Defaults to the main docDir/images toc for :jbake-type: page_toc , you need this line to generate the toc. Note Start your pages with a == level headline. You can fix the level offset when you include the page in a larger document with include::chapter.adoc[leveloffset=+1] Templates and Style The jBake templates and CSS etc. is hidden away from you for convenience. The basic template use twitter Bootstrap 5 as CSS framework. Use the copyThemes task to copy all hidden jBake resources to your project. You can then remove the ones you don&#8217;t need and change those you want to change. Note copyThemes overwrites existing files, but your code is under version control, isn&#8217;t it? Landing Page Put a index.gsp page as landing page in src/site/templates . This landing page is plain HTML5 styled with twitter bootstrap. Header and footer is added by docToolchain. An example can be found through copyThemes or on github . Blog The microsite also contains a simple but powerful blog. Use it to inform your team about changes and architecture decision records (ADRs). To create a new blog post, create a new file in src/docs/blog/&lt;year&gt;/&lt;post-name&gt;.adoc with the following template: blog post template :jbake-title: &lt;title-of your post&gt; :jbake-date: &lt;date formatted as 2021-02-28&gt; :jbake-type: post :jbake-tags: &lt;blog, asciidoc&gt; :jbake-status: published :imagesdir: ../../images == {jbake-title} {jbake-author} {jbake-date} &lt;insert your text here&gt; Search The microsite does not bring its own local search. Instead, it only has a search input-field which can be used to link to another search engine. CI/CD When run in an automated build, you should set the environment variable DTC_HEADLESS to true or 1 to ensure that docToolchain will not ask to install the configured theme. It will simply assume that you do want to install it. To avoid the download of the theme with every build, you can copy the themes folder from $HOME/.doctoolchain/themes to the corresponding folder in your build container.

If you want to use another way to create a PDF, use PhantomJS for instance and script it. The PDF is generated directly from your AsciiDoc sources without the need of an intermediate format or other tools. The result looks more like a nicely rendered book than a print-to-pdf HTML page. It is very likely that you need to theme you PDF - change colors, fonts, page header, and footer. This can be done by creating a custom-theme.yml file. As a starting point, copy the file src/docs/pdfTheme/custom-theme.yml from docToolchain to your project and reference it from your main .adoc`file via setting the `:pdf-stylesdir: . For instance, insert :pdf-stylesdir: ../pdfTheme at the top of your document to reference the custom-theme.yml from the /pdfTheme folder.

    "text": " Table of Contents publishToConfluence Configuration CSS Styling Source publishToConfluence 6 minutes to read This target takes the generated HTML file, splits it by headline and pushes it to Confluence. This enables you to use the docs-as-code approach while getting feedback from non-techies through Confluence comments. And it fulfills the requirement of &#8230;&#8203; but all documentation is in Confluence. Special features: [source] -blocks are converted to code-macro blocks in confluence. only pages and images which have changed between task runs are really published and hence only for those changes notifications are sent to watchers. This is quite important - otherwise watchers are easily annoyed by too many notifications. :keywords: Keywords are attached as labels to every generated Confluence page. The rules for page labels should be kept in mind. See https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/add-remove-and-search-for-labels-136419.html . Several keywords are allowed. They must be separated by comma, e.g. :keywords: label_1, label-2, label3, &#8230;&#8203; . Labels (keywords) must not contain a space character! Use '_' or '-'. Note code-macro-blocks in confluence render an error if the language attribute contains an unknown language. See https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/code-block-macro-139390.html for a list of valid language and how to add further languages. Configuration We tried to make the configuration self-explaining, but there are always some note to add. ancestorId this is the page ID of the parent page to which you want your docs to be published. Go to this page, click on edit and the needed ID will show up in the URL. Specify the ID as string within the config file. api for cloud instances, [context] is wiki preambleTitle the title of the page containing the preamble (everything the first second level heading). Default is 'arc42' disableToC This boolean configuration define if the Table of Content (ToC) is disabled from the page once uploaded in confluence. (it is false by default, so the ToC is active) pagePrefix/pageSuffix Confluence can&#8217;t handle two pages with the same name. Moreover, the script matches pages regardless of the case. It will thus refuse to replace a page whose title only differs in case with an existing page. So you should create a new confluence space for each piece of larger documentation. If you are restricted and can&#8217;t create new spaces, you can use this pagePrefix / pageSuffix to define a prefix/suffix for this doc so that it doesn&#8217;t conflict with other page names. credentials Use username and password or even better username and api-token. You can create new API-tokens in your profile . To avoid having your password or api-token versioned through git, you can store it outside of this configuration as environment variable or in another file - the key here is that the config file is a groovy script. e.g. you can do things like credentials = user:${new File(/home/me/apitoken).text}.bytes.encodeBase64().toString() To simplify the injection of credentials from external sources there is a fallback. Should you leave the credentials field empty, the variables confluenceUser and confluencePassword from the build environment will be used for authentication. You can set these through any means allowed by gradle like the gradle.properties file in the project or your home directory, environment variables or command-line flags. For all ways to set these variables, have a look at the gradle manual . apikey In cases where you have to use full user authorization because of internal confluence permission handling, you need to add the API-token in addition to the credentials. The API-token cannot be added to the credentials as it is used for user and password exchange. Therefore the API-token can be added as parameter apikey, which makes the addition of the token as a separate header field with key: keyId and value of apikey . Example including storing of the real value outside this configuration: apikey = ${new File(/home/me/apitoken).text} . extraPageContent If you need to prefix your pages with a warning that this is generated content - this is the right place. enableAttachments If value is set to true , your links to local file references will be uploaded as attachments. The current implementation only supports a single folder. This foldername will be used as a prefix to validate if your file should be uploaded or not. In case you enable this feature, and use a folder which starts with attachment*, an adaption of this prefix is required. jiraServerId the jira server id your confluence instance is connected to. If value is set, all anchors pointing to a jira ticket will be replaced by the confluence jira macro. To function properly jiraRoot has to be configured (see [exportJiraIssues] ). Example: All files to attach will require to be linked inside the document. link:attachement/myfolder/myfile.json[My API definition] attachmentPrefix The expected foldername of your output dir. Default : attachment proxy If you need to provide a proxy to access Confluence, you may set a map with keys host (e.g. 'my.proxy.com' ), port (e.g. '1234' ) and schema (e.g. 'http' ) of your proxy. useOpenapiMacro If this option is present and equal to confluence-open-api then any source block marked with class openapi will be wrapped in Elitesoft Swagger Editor macro: (see Elitesoft Swagger Editor ) For backward compatibility: If this option is present and equal to true , then again the Elitesoft Swagger Editor macro will be used. If this option is present and equal to open-api then any source block marked with class openapi will be wrapped in Open API Documentation for Confluence macro: (see Open API Documentation for Confluence ).

Note that you likely do NOT want to include the whole thing, as some of the definitions are likely to disrupt Confluence&#8217;s layout. The following style definitions are believed to be Confluence-compatible, and enable use of the built-in roles ( big / small , underline / overline / line-through , COLOR / COLOR -background for the sixteen HTML color names ): .big{font-size:larger} .small{font-size:smaller} .underline{text-decoration:underline} .overline{text-decoration:overline} .line-through{text-decoration:line-through} .aqua{color:#00bfbf} .aqua-background{background-color:#00fafa} .black{color:#000} .black-background{background-color:#000} .blue{color:#0000bf} .blue-background{background-color:#0000fa} .fuchsia{color:#bf00bf} .fuchsia-background{background-color:#fa00fa} .gray{color:#606060} .gray-background{background-color:#7d7d7d} .green{color:#006000} .green-background{background-color:#007d00} .lime{color:#00bf00} .lime-background{background-color:#00fa00} .maroon{color:#600000} .maroon-background{background-color:#7d0000} .navy{color:#000060} .navy-background{background-color:#00007d} .olive{color:#606000} .olive-background{background-color:#7d7d00} .purple{color:#600060} .purple-background{background-color:#7d007d} .red{color:#bf0000} .red-background{background-color:#fa0000} .silver{color:#909090} .silver-background{background-color:#bcbcbc} .teal{color:#006060} .teal-background{background-color:#007d7d} .white{color:#bfbfbf} .white-background{background-color:#fafafa} .yellow{color:#bfbf00} .yellow-background{background-color:#fafa00} Source publishToConfluence.gradle task publishToConfluence( description: 'publishes the HTML rendered output to confluence', group: 'docToolchain' ) { doLast { logger.info(docToolchain&gt; docDir: +docDir) binding.setProperty('config',config) binding.setProperty('docDir',docDir) evaluate(new File(projectDir, 'scripts/asciidoc2confluence.groovy')) } } scripts/asciidoc2confluence.groovy /** * Created by Ralf D.

It then creates an AsciiDoc file which just includes all files found. When you create modular documentation, most includes are static. For example, the arc42-template has 12 chapters and a master template in which those 12 chapters are included. But when you work with dynamic modules like ADRs - Architecture Decision Records - you create those files on the fly. Maybe not even within your /src/docs folder but right beside the code file for which you wrote the ADR. In order to include these files in your documentation, you now would have to add the file with its whole relative path to one of your AsciiDoc files. This task will handle it for you! Just stick with your files names to the pattern ^[A-Z]{3,}[-\_].\* (it begins with at last three upper case letters and a dash/underscore) and this task will collect this file and write it to your build folder. You only have to include this generated file from within your documentation. If you provide templates for the documents these templates are skipped if the name matches the pattern ^.*[-_][tT]emplate[-\_].* . Example: You have a file called /src/java/yourCompany/domain/books/ADR-1-whyWeUseTheAISINInsteadOFISBN.adoc The task will collect this file and write another file called /build/docs/_includes/ADR_includes.adoc Which will look like this: include::../../../src/java/yourCompany/domain/books/ADR-1-whyWeUseTheAISINInsteadOFISBN.adoc[] Obviously, you get the most benefit if you not only have one ADR file, but several ones which get collected. 😎 You then include these files in your main documentation by using a single include: include::{targetDir}/docs/_includes/ADR_includes.adoc[] scripts/collectIncludes.gradle import static groovy.io.FileType.* import java.security.MessageDigest task collectIncludes( description: 'collect all ADRs as includes in one file', group: 'docToolchain' ) { doFirst { new File(targetDir, '_includes').mkdirs() } doLast { //let's search the whole project for files, not only the docs folder //could be a problem with node projects :-) //running as subproject? set scandir to main project if (project.name!=rootProject.name &amp;&amp; scanDir=='.') { scanDir = project(':').projectDir.path } if (docDir.startsWith('.')) { docDir = file(new File(projectDir, docDir).canonicalPath) } logger.info docToolchain&gt; docDir: ${docDir} logger.info docToolchain&gt; scanDir: ${scanDir} if (scanDir.startsWith('.')) { scanDir = file(new File(docDir, scanDir).canonicalPath) } else { scanDir = file(new File(scanDir, ).canonicalPath) } logger.info docToolchain&gt; scanDir: ${scanDir} logger.info docToolchain&gt; includeRoot: ${includeRoot} if (includeRoot.startsWith('.')) { includeRoot = file(new File(docDir, includeRoot).canonicalPath) } logger.info docToolchain&gt; includeRoot: ${includeRoot} File sourceFolder = scanDir println sourceFolder:  + sourceFolder.canonicalPath def collections = [:] sourceFolder.traverse(type: FILES) { file -&gt; if (file.name ==~ '^[A-Z]{3,}[-_].*[.](ad|adoc|asciidoc)$') { def type = file.name.replaceAll('^([A-Z]{3,})[-_].*$','\$1') if (!collections[type]) { collections[type] = [] } println file:  + file.canonicalPath def fileName = (file.canonicalPath - scanDir.canonicalPath)[1..-1] if (file.name ==~ '^.*[Tt]emplate.*$') { println ignore template file:  + fileName } else { if (file.name ==~ '^.*[A-Z]{3,}_includes.adoc$') { println ignore generated _includes files:  + fileName } else { println corrected file:  + fileName if (fileName.startsWith('docToolchain')) { //ignore docToolchain as submodule } else { collections[type] &lt;&lt; fileName } } } } } println targetDir - docDir:  + (targetDir - docDir) println targetDir - includeRoot:  + (targetDir - includeRoot) def pathDiff = '../' * ((targetDir - docDir) .replaceAll('^/','') .replaceAll('/$','') .replaceAll([^/],'').size()+1) println pathDiff:  + pathDiff collections.each { type, fileNames -&gt; if (fileNames) { def outFile = new File(targetDir+'/_includes', type + '_includes.adoc') println outFile.canonicalPath-sourceFolder.canonicalPath outFile.write(// this is autogenerated\n) fileNames.sort().each { fileName -&gt; outFile.append (include::../+pathDiff+fileName.replace(\\, /)+[]\n\n) } } } } } "

Since the template exists in four different languages and with or without help on how to use it, docToolchain asks you for these two parameters. It then downloads the template right from the source, unzips it and reformats it a little bit to fit docToolchain. That&#8217;s it. You have now docToolchain with the arc42 template installed. Let&#8217;s render is as HTML, PDF or Microsite in the next steps. "

Let&#8217;s start with the installation. The following steps are the same as described in the manual. Please follow them step by step. If you encounter problems, please create a github issue and the community will help you. How to install docToolchain 5 minutes to read Get the Wrapper The basic strategy on how to install docToolchain has changed with V2.x. You now install a small wrapper scripts to your project which does the rest for you: Linux / WSL2 with bash cd &lt;your project&gt; wget doctoolchain.github.io/dtcw chmod +x dtcw if you don&#8217;t have wget installed, you can also use curl : cd &lt;your project&gt; curl -Lo dtcw doctoolchain.github.io/dtcw chmod +x dtcw Windows with Powershell cd &lt;your project&gt; wget doctoolchain.github.io/dtcw.ps1 -Outfile dtcw.ps1 Windows with cmd.exe cd &lt;your project&gt; curl -Lo dtcw.bat doctoolchain.github.io/dtcw.bat Note dtcw.bat wraps the dtcw.ps1 script and executes it in powershell. This might be easier to use if you haven&#8217;t yet configured your powershell as a developer. Note In order to support development for your project on both, Linux and Windows, it makes sense to download all three scripts to your project. Note if you use cmd.exe , please follow the instructions for powershell in the manual. We will not further differentiate between both. The wrapper helps you in several ways: it ensures that everyone who uses your repository, uses the same version of docToolchain it keeps all the technology out of your repository it wraps all your commands and directs them to your local docToolchain installation even more, it checks the way you have docToolchain installed and if it hasn&#8217;t been installed, it will install it for you via direct download or docker run a first command To get started, you can run tasks as a first command: Linux / WSL2 with bash ./dtcw tasks --group=doctoolchain Windows with Powershell ./dtcw.ps1 tasks --group=doctoolchain This command will show you all tasks available through docToolchain, but first it will make sure that docToolchain is installed: it checks for a configuration file and creates a default one if none is available. it prefers a local installation if docker is available and no local installation, it will use docker. The download of the images might take a while when run for the first time if docker is not available, it will download and install docToolchain to your home folder it will then run a gradle build through the gradle wrapper. This will download and isntall gradle when run for the first time. the gradle build will also fetch some dependencies. This will also take some time when run for the first time. As you can see, the installation is an incremental process and will take some time because of additional downloads. After the first few commands, you will have all the needed dependencies installed and things will be faster. Figure 1. Result of tasks-Task "
