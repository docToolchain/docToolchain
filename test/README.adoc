dtcw Automated Tests
--------------------
:license: MIT

This directory contains automated tests for the `dtcw` Bash wrapper script.
The tests use https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core[bats-core], a Bash automated testing system.

Documentation for `bats-core` can be found at https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/.
Detailed documentation to the helper libraries can be found in their git repositories:

- https://github.com/bats-core/bats-support[bats-support]
- https://github.com/bats-core/bats-assert[bats-assert]
- https://github.com/bats-core/bats-file[bats-file]
- https://github.com/mh182/bats-mock[bats-mock]

The test framework and the libraries are provided with git submodules.
To update the content of the submodules execute from the main project directory:

```sh
➜ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

End-to-end test cases are tagged with `e2e`. Those test cases download external
packages with `curl` or https://sdkman.io/[`sdk`] and change the system. It is
self-evident that those tests have a long runtime.

[WARNING]
Tests tagged with `e2e` **have to be executed in a container** to ensure a
deterministic test setup and to prevent a pollution of the system with test
artifacts.

Test Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[WARNING]
The test teardown routines delete `$HOME/.doctoolchain` and thus possible local installations.
To be on the save side install a container runtime and run the tests in a
container as explained in <<Execute End-to-end Tests>>.


The test suite is executed with the following command from the `docToolchain` project root directory,

```sh
# Run all tests except end-to-end tests tagged with 'e2e'
➜ ./test/bats/bin/bats --filter-tags \!e2e test

# Run all tests of a test suite file
➜ ./test/bats/bin/bats test/pristine_environment.bats

# Only run tests which match a regular expression
➜ ./test/bats/bin/bats -f "show version info" test
```

Additional information about how you can tweak test execution start the container with the `--help` option

```sh
➜ ./test/bats/bin/bats --help
```

Execute End-to-end Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Pre-requisites**: installed container runtime (Docker or Podman).

As mentioned before, end-to-end tests have to be executed in a container image.
We use the offical https://hub.docker.com/_/debian[Debian Image] to run the test suite.

NOTE: `bats-core` provides a container images which is based on https://musl.libc.org/[musl libc].
The musl C library causes problems with Java. So we use a Debian based test container with a standard glibc.


```sh
# From the docToolchain project root
➜ docker run --rm -it -v "${PWD}/dtcw:/code/dtcw" -v "${PWD}/test:/code/test" -w "/code" debian:stable-slim ./test/bats/bin/bats test
```

The volume bind mounts make `dtcw` and the test code available at `/code`.
This setup provides a clean project setup and avoids possible pitfalls to access resources from the docToolchain project directory.

```sh
# In the container we have a pristine project which uses the docToolchain
code
├── dtcw
└── test
    ├── pristine_environment.bats
    └── README.adoc
```

You probably want to create an alias to run the test suite

```sh
➜ alias tdtcw='docker run --rm -it -v "${PWD}/dtcw:/code/dtcw" -v "${PWD}/test:/code/test" -w "/code" debian:stable-slim ./test/bats/bin/bats'
➜ tdtcw test
```

Debugging
~~~~~~~~~

To access the test environment in the container provide the bind mounts without executing any command.

```sh
➜ docker run --rm -it -v "${PWD}/dtcw:/code/dtcw" -v "${PWD}/test:/code/test" -w "/code" debian:stable-slim
bash-5.2#
```

TODO
~~~~

Increase Test Coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Test Code
^^^^^^^^^

* Skip e2e tests if they are not executed in a container.

dtcw
^^^^

* Provide detailed information which Java is downloaded/installed.
* Can we make `Gradle` less noisy by default?
* Provide --verbose flag
