dtcw Automated Tests
--------------------
:license: MIT

**Pre-requisites**: installed container runtime (Docker or Podman).

This directory contains automated tests for the `dtcw` Bash wrapper script.
The tests use https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core[bats-core], a Bash automated testing system.

Documentation for `bats-core` can be found at https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/.
Detailed documentation to the helper libraries can be found in their git repositories:

- https://github.com/bats-core/bats-assert[bats-assert]
- https://github.com/bats-core/bats-file[bats-file]
- https://github.com/bats-core/bats-support[bats-support]


The test suite is executed in a container with an image provided from the `bats-core` project.
This ensures a deterministic test setup and prevents a pollution with test artifacts.

NOTE: `bats-core` provides a container images which is based on https://musl.libc.org/[musl libc].
The musl C library causes problems with Java. So we use a Debian based test container with a standard glibc.

Test Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The test suite is executed with the following command from the `docToolchain` project root directory,

```sh
# From the docToolchain project root
➜ docker run -it -e BATS_LIB_PATH=/usr/lib/bats -v "${PWD}/dtcw:/code/dtcw"  -v "${PWD}/test:/code/test" maxh/bats:latest test
```

The environment variable `BATS_LIB_PATH` assures our test code can load the `bat-core` helper libraries which are part of the container image at `/usr/lib/bats`.
The volume bind mounts make `dtcw` and the test code available at `/code`.
For more details check the https://github.com/mh182/bats-core/blob/docker_debian/Dockerfile[bats-coder/Dockerfile]

This setup provides a clean project setup and avoids possible pitfalls to access resources from the docToolchain project directory.

```sh
# In the container we have a pristine project which used the docToolchain
code
├── dtcw
└── test
    ├── pristine_environment.bats
    └── README.adoccode
```

You probably want to create an alias to run the test suite

```sh
➜ alias tdtcw='docker run -it -e BATS_LIB_PATH=/usr/lib/bats -v "${PWD}/dtcw:/code/dtcw"  -v "${PWD}/test:/code/test" maxh/bats:latest'
➜ tdtcw test
```

Tests are tagged so the test set execution may be adapted with the `--filter-tags` option.
Currently followinf tags are used:

- `download`: test is downloading external packages with `curl`, `wget` or https://sdkman.io/[`sdk`]

For example to run all tests, except the tests downloading packages use

```sh
➜ tdtcw test --filter-tags \!download
```

Additional information about how you can tweak test execution start the container with the `--help` option

```sh
➜ tdtcw --help
```

Debugging
~~~~~~~~~

To access the test environment in the container call `bash` as entrypoint,

```sh
➜ docker run -it -e BATS_LIB_PATH=/usr/lib/bats -v "${PWD}/dtcw:/code/dtcw" -v "${PWD}/test:/code/test" --entrypoint bash maxh/bats:latest
bash-5.2#
```

Creating the bats-core Test Image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

```
➜ git clone -b docker_debian git@github.com:mh182/bats-core.git && cd bats-core
➜ docker build --tag maxh/bats:latest .
➜ docker image push maxh/bats:latest
```
