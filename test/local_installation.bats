# Test installation on a clean environment

# This means: no docToolchain, no Java, no SDKMAN!, no docker
#
# The tests follow the installation instructions based on the output provided by `dtcw`.
# They download external software packages (Java, docToolchain) which makes them slow.
#
# ATTENTION: contrary to good test patterns, the tests in this file depend on
# each other to keep the test execution (and downloads) as short as possible.

# TODO: write mocks for wget/curl which use a local cache instead of downloading
# the packages each time.
